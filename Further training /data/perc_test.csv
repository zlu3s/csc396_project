She thinks its all okay.
She expects me to forget the pain,
She caused me every day.
Things seen and heard being drilled in my head,
She doesn't love me, she doesn't care,
Is what she has said.
It is so hard for me
but I am forced to be normal
..She chooses not to see..
She tore my life apart.
with all this hate and despise
It was hard to make a new start.
What have I done to deserve this.
A monster in my life, 
She thanks my crying for her bliss.
My heart sinking deeper then the ocean
at just the sound of her name.
hiding my true emotion.
Sitting, waiting. . all night I pray.
For her to stop
to go away.
but will she ever leave?
so I can stop this same old Prayer
Maybe then it won't be so hard to breathe
Maybe then life will seem fair.
Thoughts of her go through my mind,
I try to block them out.
But I was stuck there for such a long time.
They make me mad.
so No she hasn't succeeded
for I am no longer sad.
I have cried enough tears to fill up the sea,
there is nothing left to do
but let the bad thoughts flee.
I tell myself to forget 
but the dreams that haunt me every night 
are about one thing. . her ..and the time that I regret.
She made me realize I have no trust.
Not even for myself,
She made me forget the feeling of lust.
So I want to thank her, 
for I can no longer be hurt.
Maybe one day we will meet again.
I cant wait for that day to come,
just so I can remind her
She is no longer my mum",3.0
1,405,"This morning’s surprise

This morning’s surprise is how much I’ll miss rail travel.
The green fields looming up and falling behind,
the milky tea wobbling in a plastic cup,
the engine’s steady vibration.

This afternoon’s surprise is how many shades of red there are,
each one sitting in a room of its own, dense in meditation.
Each one a field of conflict, a medium of conciliation.

This evening’s surprise is not that the novel ends
in a desultory return to the working week -
loose ends trimmed and tucked out of sight -
but the ferocity of my recoil
at the author’s glib contrivance.

Midnight’s surprise is Lorca’s moon floating over Hackney
full-faced, round-eyed and speaking Spanish.

My horse is there in front of me
Clip-cloppin' down the road.
He stops and flips his tail straight up
And drops another load.

My cows dump in the meadow,
My chickens foul their coop,
And flies are buzzin' 'round and 'round
Eatin' all that poop.

The sheep are out there bleatin'...
I gotta' get a grip!
The stupid things are standin'
Knee-deep in their dip!

I swear on this here farm
There's every barnyard species,
And each and every one of them
Is makin' tons of feces.

I'm tired of smellin' livestock.
I'd like to take a nap.
But I can't sleep 'cause I dream of
Hogs wallowin' in their crap.

Cookin' soup du jour,

the day that you were born.
Never knew how wonderful it would be,
to explore motherhood.
But since I got the chance to
I have to confess and say,
that I was so scared to hold you
always thought that you would break
cause you were so tiny an fragile
there was no thinking twice
but as time went on
you got bigger every moment
and the next thing I knew
is you were trying to crawl and walk
there were times when you'd fall and cry
but I would dry them tears
and you would get right back up and try again
Just thinking and looking back at the past
I've figured out
that seeing you and those cute little faces you make

Depression is running through my head,
These thoughts make me think of death, 
A darkness which blanks my mind,
A walk through the graveyard, what can I find?
Black shadows walk in between the graves,
How many lives have not been saved?
Six feet under if not more,
How I’d like to go down and explore,
The feeling of lying in a box,
I can’t get out, is it locked?
Is it day or is it night? 
Are birds singing or have bats taken to flight?
I know one day this is where I’ll go,
Am I afraid? I don’t think so!
Will I be able to explore the feeling of death?
After I’ve taken my last breath?
Or will I be a shadow in between the graves?
Will I know how many lives have not been saved?
After this life is there another one?
With a different moon and a different sun,
I won’t go to hell as I’m already there,
A place full of sadness, a place full of despair,
So there’s nothing to live for, no future no past,
So I might as well end it, end this life at last.

So now he has had his eyes done, 
and at last he can see,

but I was a bit worried, 
what would he think of me?

You see, he hadn't seen me, 
out of two good eyes,

would I be a total shock, 
or a nice surprise?

He said ""my God, you are almost grey, 
you're eyes are much too small,

you are old and fat and ugly,
I'm not impressed at all""

But as I sat there crying, 
I suddenly noticed that---

he wasn't looking my way,

with all that he can see

There is a kingdom of the spirit's ease.
        It is not in this helpless swirl of thought,
        Foam from the world-sea or spray-whisper caught,
With which we build mind's shifting symmetries,
Nor in life's stuff of passionate unease,
        Nor the heart's unsure emotions frailty wrought
        Nor trivial clipped sense-joys soon brought to nought
Nor in this body's solid transiences.

Wider behind than the vast universe

Suddenly there was a tremor in the air, and the sky seemed to
kiss me on my forehead. My mind started up like the morning out of

I forgot to follow the track. I stepped a few paces from the
path, and my familiar world appeared strange to me, like a flower
I had only known in bud.

Foople Dee Doo wanted to eat something new,
So he went in the kitchen and tried some pea soup
Then ran to the toilet and threw up the goop

Then Foople Dee Doo felt sick
So he called the doctor named Mick
Mick said he was fine,
Then went home to dine,
On mac & cheese which he ate with a stick

The doctor named Mick had a wife
Who pricked herself with a knife
The blood oozed out,
The wife started to shout,
Mick sighed and said ""Get a life!""

She had a son named Larry
She worried about him day and night,
Until they got in a great big fight,
In the end she gave him to his aunt named Terry

Larry met a girl who said she liked puffins
But he thought she said she liked muffins
So he went to the store,
And there were more,
Muffins than he'd ever seen

The girl's name was Tasha
But she liked to go by Sasha
She really loved puffins
But a boy bought her some muffins
And she started to love those instead

Larry and Sasha got married
Which they had to have slightly tarried
They had a baby boy
The first word he said was ""toy""
He later grew up to be a prince

The prince was always sad
Some people thought he was mad
Then one day he saw a girl
Who looked like she was about to hurl
He sat her down and gave her a crown, then said, ""This will be the one I marry!""

For he had a lovely wife,
Who never pricked herself with a knife,
And they lived happily ever after

What sways the blades of grass
Throughout the world
In what delight everything shivers;
In the dark how shine stars;
In what great urge

When we woke up and looked at each other’s face.

Taking your hand in my hand
I kept looking at the sky

And didn’t know how our time passed
That day I had realized in my heart of hearts
Where end the meanings of our words
How music rises from the core of the universe
How the pining woods blossom into flowers
These we realized when both of us wept
In endless pleasure.

Silently burn the winds of spring
Why the morning sun
Yearns to get lost in everything
Why day and night the river runs
To meet the sea
Why the lightning is hurt by its own light
What game the night plays with dawn
Accepting defeat

 Remember your crores stacked away. . .
 Your Harvard airs helps in large doses
 Soon, the colors peel away and there is nothing
 To do than wrestle with your yearnings.

 Wanna fuck? It is easier saying it this way
 For something that you paid for in cash

 But never had the courage to talk
 To her of love or loneliness. . .

 You guarded it with LoCs and walls
 And barbed wire fences where hatred

 A collective manhood of nuclear warheads

 To make her yours and yours alone,
 You pushed her deeper into harems
 Where she could see the sunlight
 Only from the lattice windows.
 Domesticated into drudgery she was just
 Another territory, worn out by wars. A slave
 Who maintained your numbers.

“Let’s make love.”

 What’s taking her so long to undress?
 Quick! Sooner!

“Oh how nice to have made love.”

I am happy. Life is good / I would love to make love.
You are trespassing on my territory/ She’s mine.

Six sentences the male of a grasshopper can ever say.

You don’t know if you are yielding or resisting

it is the last day of the year
and you think about writing
a farewell poem for the year
that was, for the year you
began writing poetry

you think of the tragedies
you know, you even plan
to write about naming your only
daughter (whenever she is born,
anyway) after a suicide-bomber
you try to think of fear and hate
and some devious defence for all
those sins you had painstakingly
planned to do just so that your
poetry has more life and colour
and verve and in the end it might
appear that you have experience

you strive like mad to avoid writing
poems about your unseen lover,
you concede deep within that you
do not know his name or age or what
he murders for a living, yet he weaves
his way into every poem of yours

you want to write that single poem
which is free of him, which does not
carry the stains of his masculine scent
and which doesn’t make you think of
his hairless chest and the deftness of his
fingers on you and god yes god his eyes
you want to write a poem just for yourself,
a poem where you do not cringe
or stand shame-faced at his
worship of himself and how
silently and steadfastly he
has made you worship him

you have always known that
your knowledge of him was
very limited—that expecting
the stranger to caress you when
you cry is an insane idea—
after all when your lover comes
he has no memory about the
days and months and years he has
spent inside your heart and he does
not wish to hear for how long you
have harboured him right between
your breasts

you notice the clock tick away
and again you give up writing
that poem for it always eludes you

then,

you succumb to all your cravings
and write all you can about him
forgetting the shame and the
embarrassment it would cause
somehow it seems better than
not writing anything at all.

I always knew that love would come find me someday
but never did I know that it would be you who was headed my way
you caught me off guard and took me by surprise
but you simply captivated me, the same way you do when I look into your eyes

It's true that every good and perfect gift is from above
you were presented to me as a beautifully packaged gift full of humor, talent, intelligence, beauty and love
""it isn't finding the perfect person but learning to see an imperfect person perfectly""
we all have our flaws but when I view you through my eyes, perfection is all I see

From when you laugh to when you're upset, I still love the little things you do
especially hearing you laugh and seeing your nose wrinkle the same way mine does too
coming into this relationship has been hard at times but we've made it through
I know as long as we're on this journey together, there's nothing that we can't do.

Sometimes I wonder if what we have is too good to be true
too scared to get my heart broken and scared of the thought of losing you
but in the end, I trust in the author and perfecter of what I believe
because what we ask for in Him, we in return shall receive

""Where your treasure is, your heart will be also"" is how the saying goes
I may not know what tomorrow may bring, for God is the only one who knows
the one thing I do know is that you are my one and only
a treasure in my heart that I want to devote my whole life to completely

I know I don't need to prove my feelings to know they're true
because what I've known in my past, doesn't come close to the experience I've shared with you
I've had the experience of being in relationships before
however, this is the first time I've been truly happy... I couldn't ask for anything more
it's an honor to know that I am yours, as you are mine
and I trust God that He'll bring us together in His beautiful time

For now, I'll be waiting patiently for that day when we'll be together
that precious moment in time when I'll say, ""it's you that I want to be with forever""
God made everything beautiful, precious and new
just as beautiful and precious as the day will be, when I look into your eyes and say, ""I Love You""

'Twas the Night Before Christmas 

'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;
The children were nestled all snug in their beds;
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow,
Gave a lustre of midday to objects below,
When what to my wondering eyes did appear,
But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny rein-deer,
With a little old driver so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment he must be St. Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:
""Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donder and Blixen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!""
As leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;
So up to the housetop the coursers they flew
With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too—
And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack.
His eyes—how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow;
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath;
He had a broad face and a little round belly
That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight—
“Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!”

Are you a mere picture, and not as true as those stars, true as
this dust? They throb with the pulse of things, but you are
immensely aloof in your stillness, painted form.
The day was when you walked with me, your breath warm, your
limbs singing of life. My world found its speech in your voice, and
touched my heart with your face. You suddenly stopped in your walk,
in the shadow-side of the Forever, and I went on alone.
Life, like a child, laughs, shaking its rattle of death as it
runs; it beckons me on, I follow the unseen; but you stand there,
where you stopped behind that dust and those stars; and you are a

it would stop the river in its flow, and the foot-fall of dawn in

vanished in the hopeless dark, the woodland shade of summer would
die with its dreams.
Can it be true that I forgot you? We haste on without heed,
forgetting the flowers on the roadside hedge. Yet they breathe
unaware into our forgetfulness, filling it with music. You have
moved from my world, to take seat at the root of my life, and
therefore is this forgetting-remembrance lost in its own depth.
You are no longer before my songs, but one with them. You came

Oh, money, the life-giving juice of society!
It brings us its blessings of every variety,
It softens the blows that lifetime delivers,
It favors the brave and it crowns achievers.

It renders us free from oppression by jerks,
From mockings, and putdowns, and scoldings,and smirks.
It lets us buy tickets and travel away
From where we're not welcome but are forced to just stay.

From creditors' letters and big ugly urbs,
From all that don't matter, from stuff that disturbs,
To wide sandy beaches and azure blue waters,
Away from the smoke of ten million motors.

With money it all starts to fall into place-
No longer respect is what you have to chase.
It follows you like an afternoon shadow
Thank money, it makes you a prince from a padow.

With money, all people will treat you much better,
As you are no longer society's debtor.
Sweet smiles on you they will now bestow,
Obsequious looks in their eyes then will glow.

And women forgetting your age and your weight,
Your looks and your height and your bald, shining pate,
Will wink and remark how handsome you are
For, in their minds, you are now a star.

Oh, how pathetic society is!
A ""Miss"" is now where there used to be ""Ms.""
For quickly they learned that you've got all this dough,
And then they appear from above and below.

For freedom, for joy and enjoyment of senses,
Don't waste precious time chasing empty pretenses.
Just line up your pockets with luscious green money
And soon you'll be hugging a cute Playboy bunny.

As long as you're here on our green Earth,
And want to be living in freedom and mirth,

For cash makes the world go smoothly around.

The memories of all loves merging with this one love of ours –
And the songs of every poet past and forever.

It's taboo to say I love you
just because I feel
the words rising in me
strong and clear and real

I hear the words
I love you
rising in my throat
But my throat closes on them

I try to say the words
and almost choke
It's taboo

It's taboo to say I love your touch
the feeling of your skin
the warmth of your flesh
your heartbeat deep within

It's taboo

I don't know who taught me
must have been long ago
But clearly, strongly, deeply
I know

It's taboo

I almost broke the silence
many, many times
But was held back by the feeling
that to say
I love you
was not just taboo
but to lie

To feel love
is taboo
an even deeper taboo

I don't know who taught me
must have been long ago
But clearly, strongly, deeply
I know
It's taboo


The punishment?  Humiliation
The punishment?  Shame
The punishment?  Consternation
The punishment?  Blame
or blankness
or a thankless sigh

I'm unsure of the punishment
But I'd rather die

No one can make me
say
I love you
No one can break me
or my heart
in two

Except
I long to say
I love you
I long to praise
all of you
I long to feel
a closeness
that's taboo

It's taboo
to say
I love you
Yet I long to say the words

It's taboo
to feel

such feelings

What if the words fall once more on deaf ears?
What if they once more go unheard?
And what if I'm wrong?
What if this isn't love I'm feeling at all?

Yet you say you love me
That's not taboo
for you
And I feel your words
throughout me
That's not taboo

Inside me, turmoil
Outside, a quiet look
As inside I struggle with an age-old

 taboo

103,54,"Could I ever forget him

by Lalan

English version by Deben Bhattacharya
Original Language Bengali

Could I ever forget him
since I delivered my heart
at his feet?
His beauty enchants my eyes
round the compass
wherever I steer myself.

Though all call him black,
He is not black.
He is the glow of the moon--
the black moon,
and there is no other moon to equal him....

I ask for a moment's indulgence to sit by thy side. The works 
that I have in hand I will finish afterwards. 

Away from the sight of thy face my heart knows no rest nor respite, 
and my work becomes an endless toil in a shoreless sea of toil. 

Today the summer has come at my window with its sighs and murmurs; and
the bees are plying their minstrelsy at the court of the flowering grove. 

Now it is time to sit quite, face to face with thee, and to sing 
dedication of life in this silent and overflowing leisure

There once was a monkey in a city’s zoo,
who dreamed of the outside sun.
He did like hitting kids with poo,
but he felt that that’s been done.

So he climbed out in the middle of night, 
and explored through the cities streets.
He stopped when it was turning light 
And felt he wanted to eat.

That poor monkey needed cash 
to afford his exotic meals.
But his stomach led him to the trash,
where he ate a cube of butter and apple peels.

If he wanted to eat, he needed a job,
to pay for the food on his tummy.
So he asked many snobs,
but each time he left without money.

He tried to be an actor,
but found out he couldn't sing or cry.
He had the smarts to be a politician,
but found out he couldn't lie.

None one wanted his application.
No one gave him a chance.
Some were scared because he was from another nation.
Other because he didn’t own pants.

He only found one job, 
that paid food and shelter instead of wages.
All he was asked to do,
was to sit inside steel cages,
and dream of the outside sun.

I want to live with you
in a house by the river
the shyest violets
in the twilight
the darkest greens
on the island
in the river

I want to give you
my love
my loving

Time for building
and refining
the plans and the designing
buying lumber
then constructing
so next summer
if we're lucky
we'll live in our
house by the river 

that house that
lives inside me
I'll build it
with you
We'll build it
and reside there
in our house
by the river

 

Heavy breezes
by the river
bring me to dreaming
of our house
that we'll be building
by the river

 
Large white-framed windows
a glassed-in veranda
flowing water until winter
rustling leaves in the darkness
near that house
that lives inside me
time to build
and reside there
that house
by the river


I want to live with you
in a house by the river
the shyest violets
in the twilight
the darkest greens
on the island
in the river

I want to give you
my love
my loving

 

Time for building
and refining
the plans and the designing
buying lumber
then constructing
so next summer -
I feel so lucky -
we'll live in our
house by the river

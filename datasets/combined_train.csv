0,409,"I walked on a path through the jungle

by Jiddu Krishnamurti




I walked on a path through the jungle
Which an elephant had made,
And about me lay a tangle of wilderness.
The voice of desolation fills the distant plain.
And the city is noisy with the bells of a tall temple.
Beyond the jungle are the great mountains,
Calm and clear.

In the fear of Life
The temptation of sorrow is created.

Cut down the jungle -- not one mere tree,
For Truth is attained
By putting aside all that you have sown.

And now I walk with the elephant.",1.0

Talk to me, javas, talk to me --
what austerities did you do to get Syama Ma's feet?
Torn from your stems on illusion's plants,
falling scattered to the ground at Her feet,
     you got liberation
          bursting open
     beside yourselves with joy.
If only I could learn from your example
my life might bear fruit.
Thousands of sweet-smelling flowers bloom in the woods,
and they're all such beauties! So how come
          you got Ma's feet?
          You're just ignoran't javas!

Crimson like you at the Mother's feet,
when will they be flowers
          offered to Her, blessed by Her?
When will they turn red
          at the touch of Her feet?
When will they, just like you, blush scarlet --

A lovers dance is patient and kind
It feeds your heart, soul and mind
It brings you joy and happiness within
Knowing that he or she will be with you
Through thick and thin.

Only if the partners heart has not been
Fractured.

It plays no one not even games.

Easy to learn but hard to find.

and may be we will
almost fall in love. . .
I will look into his eyes,
and he into mine—
my one single eye,
(the unfortunate other
blinded by a disciplinizing slap)
and we will agree, adjust
that Love can be Blind.
And he, healthy boy
well-fed, white with his rosy cheeks,
will wonder about me,
pity my bony body, those thin ribs
and worry
and feel my twisted ears
and the scars on my hands,
(reminders of the flirtation
of my skin and a cruel cane)
and perhaps lift my skirt. . .
Before he learns the greater horrors,
I owe him the truth of me—
So, I will say to him:
“I went to school”.

Early in the day it was whispered that we should sail in a boat, 
only thou and I, and never a soul in the world would know of this our 
pilgrimage to no country and to no end. 

In that shoreless ocean, 
at thy silently listening smile my songs would swell in melodies, 
free as waves, free from all bondage of words. 

Is the time not come yet? 
Are there works still to do? 
Lo, the evening has come down upon the shore 
and in the fading light the seabirds come flying to their nests. 

Who knows when the chains will be off, 
and the boat, like the last glimmer of sunset, 
vanish into the night?",1.0

Three years ago my papa died, 
I remember all the tears I cried.
I remember the times of basketball, 
Eating ice cream, cookies, and all.
He went through so much pain, 
I don’t think I could do the same.
Staying alive through the years, 
Never letting me see his tears.
I was writing him lots of letters, 
Hoping it would make him better.
Although it made me sad, 
When he went to a better place it made me glad.
Every time he gave me a hug,
He made me feel snug as a rug.
He died before my sister was born, 
It is very hard not to mourn.
I remember how we use to talk, 
Making me laugh when my mom he mocked.
I talk to him everyday, 
Never running out of things to say.
I look up in the sky, 
Remembering of when I didn’t want to say goodbye.
Forever I know we will never part, 
Because he is always in my heart.

Love adorns itself;
it seeks to prove inward joy by outward beauty.
Love does not claim possession,
but gives freedom.

Tell me no more of thy love, papeeha,
Wouldst thou recall to my heart, papeeha,
Dreams of delight that are gone,
When swift to my side came the feet of my lover
With stars of the dusk and the dawn?
I see the soft wings of the clouds on the river,
And jewelled with raindrops the mango-leaves quiver,
And tender boughs flower on the plain.....
But what is their beauty to me, papeeha,
Beauty of blossom and shower, papeeha,
That brings not my lover again? 
Tell me no more of thy love, papeeha,
Wouldst thou revive in my heart, papeeha
Grief for the joy that is gone?
I hear the bright peacock in glimmering woodlands
Cry to its mate in the dawn;
I hear the black koel's slow, tremulous wooing,
And sweet in the gardens the calling and cooing
Of passionate bulbul and dove....
But what is their music to me, papeeha
Songs of their laughter and love, papeeha,

On the path of the journey to effulgence,

The Earth, swinging in the great universal swing, has become beautiful.
Today, there is no discrimination.
Come all together, forgetting rivalry, let us all jointly announce that we are one and will remain one.
All hearts are threaded in the same garland of gems. Let us all sing the song in the same tune.
There is no high or low, black or white. All are brothers in the world.
Pain or earnestness of one, is pain or earnestness of all.
All hearts oscillate in the same swing, within the ocean of nectar, singing one song.
Full of love, arousing hope, speaking in the same tone?look ahead.

So in depth, hold on with all of my might.
Waiting in the rain, a cold winter night.
Inhale, exhale. Calm as I am.
Hair blowing in the wind.
Somebody take my hand.
My eyes they close;
As I breathe in deep
You run through my mind
And my life is complete.
I open my eyes
But you're still not there
No one could take your place.
With you my heart I share
A cold afternoon, 
Hands as cold as ice
Thoughts go through my mind
My feelings are concise
Lying in your arms
We are the perfect match
The distance is discouraging
Yet still I am attached
Sitting by the fire,
Thinking in a distant stare
Waiting under streetlights

A special world for you and me
A special bond one cannot see
It wraps us up in its cocoon
And holds us fiercely in its womb. 
Its fingers spread like fine spun gold
Gently nestling us to the fold
Like silken thread it holds us fast
Bonds like this are meant to last.

And though at times a thread may break
A new one forms in its wake
To bind us closer and keep us strong
In a special world, where we belong.

As I gaze into his liquid gold eyes,
Poetry radiates from his warm soul
His lips brush mine and I soar through the skies
Passion seizes me; I loose my control
An amalgam of thoughts pierce through my mind
There is love, trust, yet I feel petrified
I know destiny; our fate’s intertwined
But what if he’s a dream, one I’m denied?
A thousand years I could spend with those suns
Amid his presence I’ve conquered all realms
I’ve witnessed beauty that forever stuns
And have basked beneath his forest of elms
Then and there, I grasp truth with clarity
He’s in my arms; there’s no obscurity

Teach him not to seek
Where he has been taught to find. . .

***

Lead him into the land
Of silences—Ignore his words of praise
Where all the perfidy hides. . .

***

Because the climax of a dream
Is its return to reality, let him cling
To your laughter, to your eyes that shine of light. . .

***

Make him study the gilt of gold
Against the wan brown of your skin but let him choose. . .

***

Exhibit your flawless arms
Dearest child of 1984—no vaccination mark
Nothing to remind him of his Maari or small pox. . .

***

Lead him to count the moles
On your skin but force him to begin
With the beauty spot above your lips. . .

***

Talk to him of that summer of chickenpox
That left you almost unscathed, but show him
The unbeautiful gash where metal seared eight-year skin. . .

***

Tell him the history of your Raphunzel hair
That tickled your shins. And of a cruel world that sapped
You, so your hair cannot reach down to cover your shame. . .

***

Press his ears against your skin
And hear him announce—the dance
Is in the bones, the dance is in the blood. . .

***

He shall chart and plot
And map, but shrewd girl
Bring him up to worship you. . .

***

Allow him to memorize all of you
So that, some day, he shall ravish you
Screaming fiery love-words in your mother-tongue. . .

***

He would have
Learnt your lesson, by then. . .

you told me before
we'll be together soon
but today you changed your mind
now everything seems ruined

I don't know what to say
My face a blank stare
Tears flowing out my eyes 
Life really isn't fair

You say you can't lose me
And you didn't want to hurt me
but there was no way around it
now i ask you to let me be

I need time to let you go
I need space so i can think
I'll never open up my heart again
For it to only sink

Your still my best friend
I'll always wish we were more
but i respect your wish
Tho my feelings were tore.

One moment can tell a story for years, 
Passed down with twists and turns... 
But no matter how many distortions are made, 
it is the original that is truly yours. 

'Twas the first day of school, 
such an interesting day, 
I walked the halls nervously
A lack of words to say. 

Turning a corner, 
I look up and around:
A teacher asks a boy for his name, 
I myself shocked by the sound:

The name has been spoken 
and time seems to stop; 
I look up at the boy in confusion
and feel my jaw drop. 

No way! Is it really him?
You? He? That guy?
The one I thought lost
now returned, how? why? 

Was he not gone for such a period
that I'd thought his return unseen:
Now this even is so abrupt! 
It happened so quickly...

A viva examination was almost done,
All the students had left but one,
This dental student was taking ages,
Because he couldn't answer a single question asked by the sages,
Frustrated by the long wait,
The examiner asked in haste,
""What would be the biggest problem we would face,
If nobody had teeth in the entire human race?""
He expected ""chewing"", ""speech"" or ""aesthetics"",
The question was so easy, it made the other students sick,
To hear the answer he leaned a little closer to the student,
Who simply smiled and answered ""Unemployment""

With his flame brow and his sun-gold body?

It recalled all that the life's joy cherished,
Imaged the felicity it must leave lost forever,
And the boat passed and the gold god vanished.

However regrets, I do lack.
He scribbles my words, when I can't find what to say.
He makes my thoughts audible, and in a neat and clear way.
If I make any mistakes, he's always got my back.

HAVE YOU found me, at last, O my Dream? Seven eons ago 
You died and I buried you deep under forests of snow. 
Why have you come hither? Who bade you awake from your sleep 
And track me beyond the cerulean foam of the deep? 


Would you tear from my lintels these sacred green garlands of leaves? 
Would you scare the white, nested, wild pigeons of joy from my eaves? 
Would you touch and defile with dead fingers the robes of my priest? 
Would you weave your dim moan with the chantings of love at my feast? 

Go back to your grave, O my Dream, under forests of snow, 
Where a heart-riven child hid you once, seven eons ago.

This morning’s surprise is how much I’ll miss rail travel.
The green fields looming up and falling behind,
the milky tea wobbling in a plastic cup,
the engine’s steady vibration.

This afternoon’s surprise is how many shades of red there are,
each one sitting in a room of its own, dense in meditation.
Each one a field of conflict, a medium of conciliation.

This evening’s surprise is not that the novel ends
in a desultory return to the working week -
loose ends trimmed and tucked out of sight -
but the ferocity of my recoil
at the author’s glib contrivance.

Midnight’s surprise is Lorca’s moon floating over Hackney
full-faced, round-eyed and speaking Spanish.

Syama wakes on the cremation grounds
to take Her child
at the final hour
to Her lap.
The peaceful Mother sits on the pyre
in fire hidden by Her sari of love.
     To hold him on Her lap
     She left the Kailasa of Her joy, and
     with blessings and fearlessness in Her hands
     made the cremation grounds Her home.
Why fear this place
when you'll sleep peacefully at the Mother's feet?
     Who dies ignited by the flames of this world,
     to him the Mother calls:
     ""Come to My lap, come to My lap.""
     To lull you to sleep, Oh Wearied by Life,
          Ma takes you to Her lap

I'm sorry if I wasn't strong.

I didn't mean to give you a fall.

I didn't want you to scream and shout.

I just fear you're going to be a popular one day,
I fear that and if you do, I'm going to have to pay.

And this whole time I've really been hurting underneath.

When you called me
To light up your life
I could never refuse.
But, there are things I ask of you.

Love, I can’t be a candle
For I know it is an ancient lie.
The candle is for the solemn,
And for those who yearn a slow
And settled tenderness. Not for us.
It is for those who can bear to leave
A mass of their waste, the dregs of their glory.
O, it is for the selfish who seek to burn through a medium.

Love, I will promise you a substitute.
I could be that piece of holy camphor
So safely locked away from prying hands.
And dearest, when I burn for you, that single time
Nothing shall remain of me, or of you, except that flash
Of memory. Our blending shall be so sublime, so intense, so total.

Come, consume me,
Devastate me love, if you ever will,
But with a force that I will forever remember.

The Gardener LV: It Was Mid-Day 

It was mid-day when you went 
away .
The sun was strong in the sky.
I had done my work and sat alone
on my balcony when you went away.
Fitful gusts came winnowing
through the smells of may distant
fields.
The doves cooed tireless in the shade,
and a bee strayed in my room hum-
ming the news of many distant fields.
The village slept in the noonday
heat. The road lay deserted.
In sudden fits the rustling of the
leaves rose and died.
I gazed at the sky and wove in the 
blue the letters of a name I had known,
while the village slept in the noonday
heat.
I had forgotten to braid my hair.
The languid breeze played with it upon
my cheek.
The river ran unruffled under the
shady bank.
The lazy white clouds did not move.
I had forgotten to braid my hair.
It was mid-day when you went 
away.
The dust of the road was hot and
the fields panting.
The doves cooed among the dense
leaves.
I was alone in my balcony when you
went away.

The vessel's memories haunt the gloom of the night,
I survey its changed shape since days of yore,
As I stumble, tremble and fumble to the fore,
The mute faces stare with hope as they might,
Dreaming of the New World's coming at first light,
The pining youth cross the threshold of the door,
They are visibly stricken and shaken to the core;
We are ghastly, haggard shells and filled with fright,
As our modern voyage sails into the shades of night.

My heart breaks;
A mother's fears,
A sister's tears,
My soul quakes,
A brother nears,
My Earth shakes.

Eyelid Dancing

Me on the left and you on the right
the way we laid our bodies the start of the night.

My head on two pillows as yours lay on one
tired from the day and all we had done.

One arm under pillow, the other kept you warm
I'd pull you in close during thunder and storm.

I still remember the sweet scent of your hair
As we closed our eyes and I held you for prayer.

The rise and fall of breath from your chest
would remind me of that day that God had blessed.

Your face would go soft and lips would yawn
You'd fall asleep with the television still on.

Middle of the night your house stayed warm
The fan on high was always the norm.

I'd stolen the blanket and kicked down the sheet
The only pillow you had now lay at your feet.

Sometimes I'd wake while there you still lay
I'd creep to your bedside and kneel as to pray.

I would lean in close as if to steal a kiss
These moments of affection are the ones that I miss.

I’d sit and watch while you lay there and snore
I’d sometimes fall asleep with my head on the floor.

You always thought you slept without peep
Instead of counting them you baa’d like a sheep.

Your body lay still ‘cept for the rise and fall 
Of your beautiful body that lay there in sprawl.

But the most memorable part of those sleepless nights
Wasn’t the snoring, the prayer or absence of lights-

It was the way in which your eyes would flicker
Beneath lid and lash I would try not to snicker.

To me it was funny to just watch them move
As if they were dancers stepping to groove.

I could only guess what your mind would dream
Maybe thoughts of our future and how it would seem.

Would it be an uphill battle, a test for all time?, 
Or simply steps in a stairwell that together we’d climb.

Most of the mornings you’d wake with a smile
And some you slept in for at least a little while.

But now these memories are just written in line
And filed in a cabinet in the back of my mind.

Memory of you sleeping, snoring, eyes wide shut
Now my heart beating, bleeding, crimson and cut. 

Your eyelids would flutter as your eyes would dance
And I’d pray to God to just give me the chance-

To fix what I'd done and to right the wrong 
Of the poor choices that I'd hidden for oh so long.

These are the thoughts I now remember the most
the memories in my heart I still hold so close.

Times I sat by your side as night was still grey
All through the morning before dark turned to day.

I’d ask Him to bless this love I’d forsaken
Taken for granted and stole for the taking.

Unfortunately I received a different kind of answer
but you will always remain my eyelid dancer.

70,708,"I Needed You

When I was sad and depressed,
I needed you to be cheer me up.
Instead I drank till I was numb enough not to feel anything.

When everyone was attacking me and putting me down, making me feel so low,
I needed you to be the one to defend me and be on my side
Instead I endured all the cruel words and criticism the world threw at me.

When I lost all my friends and had no one,
I needed you to be that only friend I had left, 
Instead I experience what the word ""friendless"" really meant.

When I was scared and frightened,
I needed you to be my security blanket.
Instead I had to live in fear.

When I was angry and full of rage,
I needed you to calm me down,
Instead I kept it all bottled up inside.

When I felt so lonely and needed someone to care,
I needed you to hold me tight and never let me go.
Instead I grew up alone with no one to turn to.

When I was hurt and in pain,
I needed you to come running with you healing ways.
Instead I remained scarred and bruised.

When I would inflict self-torture, wanting to die,
I needed you to stop me and tell me how important I was.
Instead I hid my scars and became oblivious to everyone.

When I would cry myself to sleep at night,
I needed you to wipe the tears away.
Instead I held my pillow tight while never ending tears streamed down my face.

When my world was crashing down on me,
I needed you to be the one I ran to.
Instead I locked myself in my room in complete despair.

When I felt unloved,
I needed you to tell me how much you loved me.
Instead I learned the words ""I love you"" are meaningless.

The serpents are asleep among the poppies, 
The fireflies light the soundless panther's way 
To tangled paths where shy gazelles are straying, 
And parrot-plumes outshine the dying day. 
O soft! the lotus-buds upon the stream 
Are stirring like sweet maidens when they dream. 


A caste-mark on the azure brows of Heaven, 
The golden moon burns sacred, solemn, bright 
The winds are dancing in the forest-temple, 
And swooning at the holy feet of Night. 
Hush! in the silence mystic voices sing 
And make the gods their incense-offering. ",1.0

'Twas the Night Before Christmas 

'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;
The children were nestled all snug in their beds;
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow,
Gave a lustre of midday to objects below,
When what to my wondering eyes did appear,
But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny rein-deer,
With a little old driver so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment he must be St. Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:
""Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donder and Blixen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!""
As leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;
So up to the housetop the coursers they flew
With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too—
And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack.
His eyes—how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow;
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath;
He had a broad face and a little round belly
That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight—
“Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!”

You planned to tame a swallow, to hold her
In the long summer of your love so that she would forget
Not the raw seasons alone, and the homes left behind, but
Also her nature, the urge to fly, and the endless
Pathways of the sky. It was not to gather knowledge
Of yet another man that I came to you but to learn
What I was, and by learning, to learn to grow, but every
Lesson you gave was about yourself. You were pleased
With my body's response, its weather, its usual shallow
Convulsions. You dribbled spittle into my mouth, you poured
Yourself into every nook and cranny, you embalmed
My poor lust with your bitter-sweet juices. You called me wife,
I was taught to break saccharine into your tea and
To offer at the right moment the vitamins. Cowering
Beneath your monstrous ego I ate the magic loaf and
Became a dwarf. I lost my will and reason, to all your
Questions I mumbled incoherent replies. The summer
Begins to pall. I remember the rudder breezes
Of the fall and the smoke from the burning leaves. Your room is
Always lit by artificial lights, your windows always
Shut. Even the air-conditioner helps so little,
All pervasive is the male scent of your breath. The cut flowers
In the vases have begun to smell of human sweat. There is
No more singing, no more dance, my mind is an old
Playhouse with all its lights put out. The strong man's technique is
Always the same, he serves his love in lethal doses,
For, love is Narcissus at the water's edge, haunted
By its own lonely face, and yet it must seek at last
An end, a pure, total freedom, it must will the mirrors
To shatter and the kind night to erase the water.

Endless footsteps lead on along the ground
The grieving people that were here cannot be found
The black clouds come and hide the crying sky
Amid those timeworn, lonely echoes of goodbye

A young man lived here with a wife, a child, a song
Life he had, but somewhere something went wrong
A mistake--and he left a mourning crowd,
Left them in a dark, black, and shadowed shroud

They buried my daddy that day in the rain
And I cried as I held Momma's hand
Those tears on her face revealed all the pain
We never could quite understand
At the funeral, they'd said my daddy had been
A good man and too young to die,
And the child I had been asked over again
Why hadn't he told me goodbye?

Endless footsteps lead on along the ground
The grieving people that were here cannot be found
The black clouds come and hide the crying sky
Amid those timeworn, lonely echoes of goodbye

When memory decides
To no longer bear the burdens—
Of pain, or even plain indifference
She has her winsome wicked ways.

Some day, years later,
Life requires you to unearth
Some event long past and you
Set about browsing your brain
Like a desk-full of office files and then—
Come across a resounding emptiness.

Memories drizzle-fragile
Are not to be found. What
Greets you instead, through
Those yellowing sheets of typed matter is
The blank and ugly blotches of dried whitener
So carefully applied, then. It has a fading smell of
Chalk and chlorine: a blend, like memory, that works at
Your throat. You try to scratch it and the faintest hopes are
Betrayed as the caked pieces of the whitener crumble,
Displaying nothing, but toe curling holes where crummy paper and ink once contained you.

86,192,"Another Paradise Lost

One sleepy summer afternoon, while helping
myself to a glass of chilled water, I saw a
snake lying curled under the fridge. It could
have been a very poisonous cobra. Very

quickly, I chose my mode of attack: Acid.
Staggering, I reached for the glass bottle
so that I could pour the yellow-green cheap
acid on its slimy body, burning it to death.

“Stop it”, the snake hissed in pure Tamil
connecting with me in the language of
my prayer and poetry. “I am an exile.”
And I configured mental images of political

refugees. It wriggled out and I saw that
it was balding, almost Rushdie-like, perhaps
with a death sentence too. Controversy was a
crowd pulling catch-phrase, to which I dutifully

succumbed. Acid bottle in hand, I heard the
snake preach to me about living in detachment.
“The perfection of life is when you do not
know the difference between yielding and

resisting.” The scrawny being writhed further
and told me of rebirth and reincarnation. Being
a writer I really wanted to take notes. Instead
I began arguing. “Shut up”, the snake said to me,

“Karma and the whole stuff that follows it is just
bunkum. You, a crazed agnostic, disagree because
of borrowed ideas.” Sharp movements of the red
tongue terrified me. Almost sensing my fear, it

said, “You could never challenge what you do
not comprehend.” The snake spoke in circles, in
patterns that could only resemble a snake
swallowing its tail. Whatever. And then it

occurred to me: Speech was the oldest trap,
the charming deceiver, persuasion’s weapon
and Satan’s first area of expertise. “Stop it”,
this time I said the words. “Tell me just your

story. Save the cant and rant for critical times.”
My acidic tone gained me a menacing status
and I continued, “You are a mean serpent.
Instigator. Trouble-maker. Sly liar. Undulating

temptation-provider. Unworthy reminder
of the seduction of strength over matter.” It
protested in a booming resonant voice, “No, I
am not any of this. I am just an exile, from

paradise. Because of your Catholic upbringing,
you don’t even know about the paradise lost
in Hinduism.” Who bothered for history or
heritage, except shriveling snakes and failed

writers? At least, we both had something in
common. “Look here comrade, my credentials
are different. In heaven, I was an activist. An
avid dissenter. Before the accession to heaven,

long long ago, I was a mighty monarch on earth,
feared and respected. I was Nahusa the Great.
My subjects were happy, the kingdom prosperous.
And I ruled for twelve thousand years, until the day

when I decided that I could take leave of life. In
heaven too, I was venerated. But one question had
plagued me all the years of my long life, and it still
tormented me in heaven. I wanted to know why

caste was there, why people suffered because of
their karmas. I questioned the Gods, and the learned
sages there. I asked them what would happen if an
high-born did manual work just like the low-born.

I worried about the division of labor, this disparity
in dreams and destinies. You could say I was a rebel
pleading for liberty-equality-fraternity. I had a riotous
history of revolution. The Gods plotted against me,

decided that I was trouble. I was cursed to turn into
a vile snake. I was banished from paradise. For sixty
million years, I shall roam the earth, and then I may
return.” This was a different case of the paradise lost.

In this tale, there was no forbidden fruit, no second
fickle-minded woman. Tradition triumphed over reason
and the good were cast away. I let the serpent go,
happy that he had given my hungry mind a story, or

perhaps, a poem to be written on unfair days. I began
to respect snakes — the challengers of hierarchy.
While I gave him the freedom of safe passage
I vowed never to kill serpents. Much later

I realized brutally that this was just another
occupational hazard for choosing a life
where I was to be showing solidarity
with activists and dissenters.

You are possessed.
Witch doctors believe in phantoms,
that cause your illness. But, driving out devils
can be challenging. Spirits are given away—

We are made to sit opposite you,
Force-fed a ‘meal’—bland food mixed
with your hair, nails, spit and pus.
Illegally (despite the government ban),
We take your hoard of evil spirits
Barter-system: for having ate your food.

And because ghosts and ghouls
obey your rules, they leave you to come to us.
Is this ‘transference’? An unofficial appeasement.
We become inhabited by the dead,
who ruins our doomed lives. Demons in our
bodies are brutal tenants and frequently,

They suck with their vampire tongues
to drink our anemic blood —
leave their puncture marks, which
can be faintly seen on our black skins;
skins that bear greater scars,
reminders of larger, human cruelty. . .

Anyway, there isn’t a lot of life in our bodies.
We are souls. Wandering souls. Still, once
Ghost-tasted, we rot away. We rot away.
Remember, rotting is a long procedure. . .
Day by day, we grow coffin cold and slowly
Life creeps out, a lazy earthworm.
At last, we die.

91,448,"I Hope You Understand

You were like a father,
And my world was all clear,
I wasn't expecting much from you at first,
Then you treated me like a daughter,
I expected more then,
I thought you would keep your promises,
And now I know.

You made my life a living nightmare,
Yet I still loved you like a father,
I wasn't sure if forgiving you was right,
But every time I did anyways,
You had many chances and many opportunities,
But you used your last one.

I will always think of you as a father,
But if that last chance wasn't blown we would be together,
I hope you never think you were replaced,
Because I will always remember the good,
But the bad will be there too in my thoughts everyday.

Your life means a lot to many different people,
So please don't blow that too,
Because you only get one life and I love that life,
And I hope you do too.

Every night I worry about what you are doing,
And sometimes I cry wondering,
I just wish life didn't have to be this way,
Then I remember it doesn't.

I looked up to you and I wanted you to stay around forever,
I wanted to grow up knowing you were always going to be there,
Now I am not sure that will happen,
You are killing the thing I love most,
So now I am begging you to stop,
I want you to spend the time you have left with me and your family.

We deserve better than to sit and watch you fade away,
Soon there won't be anything left,
Think about these emotions and I hope you understand.

The Rainy Day 

Sullen clouds are gathering fast over the black fringe of the
forest.
O child, do not go out!
The palm trees in a row by the lake are smiting their heads
against the dismal sky; the crows with their dragged wings are
silent on the tamarind branches, and the eastern bank of the river
is haunted by a deepening gloom.
Our cow is lowing loud, ties at the fence.
O child, wait here till I bring her into the stall.
Men have crowded into the flooded field to catch the fishes
as they escape from the overflowing ponds; the rain-water is
running in rills through the narrow lanes like a laughing boy who
has run away from his mother to tease her.
Listen, someone is shouting for the boatman at the ford.
O child, the daylight is dim, and the crossing at the ferry
is closed.
The sky seems to ride fast upon the madly rushing rain; the
water in the river is loud and impatient; women have hastened home
early from the Ganges with their filled pitchers.
The evening lamps must be made ready.
O child, do not go out!
The road to the market is desolate, the lane to the river is
slippery. The wind is roaring and struggling among the bamboo
branches like a wild beast tangled in a net.",4.0

I don't believe in taking excess risks,
But a person can be excessively careful, too.
A friend of mine checks every detail twice;
He's the most meticulous man I ever knew.

We went to the copy store the other day;
I thought we'd be a few minutes, and then be done.
But he counted all his copies several times,

103,747,"Lover's Gifts XIX: It Is Written in the Book 

It is written in the book that Man, when fifty, must leave the
noisy world, to go to the forest seclusion. But the poet proclaims
that the forest hermitage is only for the young. For it is the
birthplace of flowers and the haunt of birds and bees; and hidden
hooks are waiting there for the thrill of lovers' whispers. There
the moon-light, that is all one kiss for the malati flowers, has
its deep message, but those who understand it are far below fifty.
And alas, youth is inexperienced and wilful, therefore it is
but meet that the old should take charge of the household, and the
young take to the seclusion of forest shades and the severe
discipline of courting.

This little flute of a reed thou hast carried over hills and dales,

At the immortal touch of thy hands my little heart loses its limits in

The fair was on before the temple.
It had rained from the early morning
and the day came to its end.
Brighter than all the gladness of
the crowd was the bright smile of
a girl who bought for a farthing a 
whistle of palm leaf.
The shrill joy of that whistle floated
above all laughter and noise.
An endless throng of people came
and jostled together. The road was
muddy, the river in flood, the field
under water in ceaseless rain.
Greater than all the troubles of
the crowd was a little boy's trouble--
he had not a farthing to buy a painted
stick.
His wistful eyes gazing at the shop
made this whole meeting of men so

We bear her along like a pearl on a string.

Softly, O softly we bear her along,
She hangs like a star in the dew of our song;
She springs like a beam on the brow of the tide,

Lips' language to lips' ears.
Two drinking each other's heart, it seems.
Two roving loves who have left home,
pilgrims to the confluence of lips.
Two waves rise by the law of love
to break and die on two sets of lips.
Two wild desires craving each other
meet at last at the body's limits.
Love's writing a song in dainty letters,
layers of kiss-calligraphy on lips.
Plucking flowers from two sets of lips
perhaps to thread them into a chain later.
This sweet union of lips
is the red marriage-bed of a pair of smiles.",2.0

Standing in self-hatred,
drowning in my tears.
Looking back on my life,
what I've been through the past 18 years.
Living in my brother's shadow,
everything I do & say,
wishing somehow things would change,
praying for a way.
Same old sh*t just another day,
living this evil life that was created just for me.
Starving for love, affection, & attention,
I know none of this is how it's really supposed to be.
I try to be strong,
even though I feel so weak.
Feel like just giving up,
but I won't accept that level of defeat.
Pretend like I'm always happy,
although I'm never really okay.
Waiting for this pain to end,
that I feel every stupid day.
It's hard to say what's wrong,
when nothings going right.
Hard to keep myself going,
when I've been blinded by sight.
This pain is never ending,
it just goes on & on & on.
It's all so unbelievably real,
I just wish it all was gone.
Trying to pick myself up,
when I've fallen so far and hard.
But I don't know where I'm going,
It's all so very dark.
My heart is weak, my emotions sore,
I do my best to never let it show.
But deep down inside I feel like,
I'm dying & nobody knows.
A lot of f***ed up thoughts,
run through my head constantly.
I just wish I didn't live,
this life of MISERY!

She walks alone in the dark.
As she looks back there are sparks.
She can hear the whispers, 
The steps, the jumps. 
She can hear the quickness, 
Just like darts. 
She walks at a pace, 
Not to fast. 
She hears the whispers, 
This makes her gasp. 
She runs as fast as she can,
Until she hears the steps again, 
A hollow speech hard and cold. 
She wants to run but, 
It's to bold. 
She runs and runs,
Until she finds, 
The sound was the wind, 
So she walks again.

Like odours of cinnamon, sandal and clove, 
Of song and sorrow and life and love.

122,545,"The Journey 

The morning sea of silence broke into ripples of bird songs; 
and the flowers were all merry by the roadside; 
and the wealth of gold was scattered through the rift of the clouds 
while we busily went on our way and paid no heed. 

We sang no glad songs nor played; 
we went not to the village for barter; 
we spoke not a word nor smiled; 
we lingered not on the way. 
We quickened our pace more and more as the time sped by. 

The sun rose to the mid sky and doves cooed in the shade. 
Withered leaves danced and whirled in the hot air of noon. 
The shepherd boy drowsed and dreamed in the shadow of the banyan tree, 
and I laid myself down by the water 
and stretched my tired limbs on the grass. 

My companions laughed at me in scorn; 
they held their heads high and hurried on; 
they never looked back nor rested; 
they vanished in the distant blue haze. 

They crossed many meadows and hills, 
and passed through strange, far-away countries. 
All honor to you, heroic host of the interminable path! 
Mockery and reproach pricked me to rise, 
but found no response in me. 

I gave myself up for lost 
in the depth of a glad humiliation 
---in the shadow of a dim delight. 

The repose of the sun-embroidered green gloom 
slowly spread over my heart. 
I forgot for what I had traveled, 
and I surrendered my mind without struggle 
to the maze of shadows and songs. 

At last, when I woke from my slumber and opened my eyes, 
I saw thee standing by me, flooding my sleep with thy smile. 
How I had feared that the path was long and wearisome, 
and the struggle to reach thee was hard!",1.0

Cradle Song

FROM groves of spice, 
O'er fields of rice, 
Athwart the lotus-stream, 
I bring for you, 
Aglint with dew 
A little lovely dream. 


Sweet, shut your eyes, 
The wild fire-fiies 
Dance through the fairy neem; 
From the poppy-bole 
For you I stole 
A little lovely dream.


Dear eyes, good-night, 
In golden light 
The stars around you gleam; 
On you I press 
With soft caress 
A little lovely dream.

A smile is just a Gesture,
That's made on one's face,
What if the knew,
All I needed was space?
I NEED to breathe,
NEED to get away,
Don't know how much longer,
I am here to stay.
We had such fun,
Used to laugh all day.
You said you wouldn't leave,
You said you would stay.
But know you are gone,
And I must force a smile,
Because you had told me,
It was just for a while.
Now we are leaving,
Leaving all our pasts here.
Ditching the friends and the family,
That have grown so dear.
You tell me to be happy,
To have fun for a while,
But how can I have fun,
When I can't find a smile?

How do you tell a friend that you are worried about them?
That you think that they are not making good decisions right now.
That it scares you to see them like this.
You know that you will be there for them, but how do you make them see that?
How do you tell them so they don't get mad?
Do you tell them straight up so they deny it saying they are ok?
It's complicated no matter who you are.
It hurts to see your friends like this.
You don't want to push them away because you have a special bond.
So how do you tell someone you love, this?
There is no easy way.

Death, rock me asleep,
Bring me to quiet rest,
Let pass my weary guiltless ghost
Out of my careful breast.
Toll on, thou passing bell;
Ring out my doleful knell;
Let thy sound my death tell.
Death doth draw nigh;
There is no remedy.

My pains who can express?
Alas, they are so strong;
My dolour will not suffer strength
My life for to prolong.
Toll on, thou passing bell;
Ring out my doleful knell;
Let thy sound my death tell.
Death doth draw nigh;
There is no remedy.

Alone in prison strong
I wait my destiny.
Woe worth this cruel hap that I
Should taste this misery!
Toll on, thou passing bell;
Ring out my doleful knell;
Let thy sound my death tell.
Death doth draw nigh;
There is no remedy.

Farewell, my pleasures past,
Welcome, my present pain!
I feel my torments so increase
That life cannot remain.
Cease now, thou passing bell;
Rung is my doleful knell;
For the sound my death doth tell.
Death doth draw nigh;
There is no remedy.

Like a joy on the heart of a sorrow,
   The sunset hangs on a cloud;
A golden storm of glittering sheaves,
Of fair and frail and fluttering leaves,
   The wild wind blows in a cloud.

Hark to a voice that is calling
   To my heart in the voice of the wind:
My heart is weary and sad and alone,
For its dreams like the fluttering leaves have gone,
   And why should I stay behind?

You are blind
You can never see
All the anger built up in me
I hated life
I wanted out
You didn’t care
You would just shout

I felt so alone
Thought I didn’t need anyone
Turns out I just needed a mum

The black sheep
I was never apart
Furthest away from your heart
Things have changed
I’m growing old
I don’t need you
You still feel cold


I’m now out of sight
Out of mind
I don’t need you, I'll do alright
I don’t need your blessing
Or your cash
Without your help I'll make a splash
Land on my feet with a crash


I’m happier than ever
My life’s brand new
And most of all
I'm not like you.

145,506,"If Perhaps...

I sit here holding deep inside
Feelings that others wish to hide
Confide in me, the troubles go
But in me they grow and grow.
I know I said I could handle it
But I wonder as I think about it.
My heart screams for sweet release
All it wants is the promise of peace
The promise I freely give to others
Can I promise myself above others?
I’ll let my promise out to you
If you will hold me as I would you.
I'll trust you if you will me
God please, protect me. 
Hold me and never let me go
But if you do, I want you to know.
I never meant to go away
My heart released it’s own way
Perhaps through fear it decided to go.
But if that’s it, I did not know.
Sometimes it acts without me
But if so, now I am free.

146,177,"A Moment Of Truth

My dear love, I wanted to share
My thoughts, my feelings and
What makes me despair
I want to share with you
What makes me happy; what makes me feel blue..
So you can sense that my love is honest and true.

Every day not a single minute
Passes by without you in it 
Your skin, your voice, your body and your touch
All of these moments, I miss them so much.

You are so present, so deep in my heart
And our souls, I just know, will never part,
But circumstance and distance can be so overwhelming
They close doors and create doubt and we start blaming..

There are actions of mine and I know that for sure..
That feel so wrong, though my intentions are pure
They are painful and impossible to bear
And you feel it's all so unfair.

You can't run from yourself;
There is no place to hide
It just hurts you so deep
It hurts your heart and your pride.

Then I worry that if I continue to stay
Will it be wrong and will I be in your way?
I fear that I am not at all what you need
And that this truth will make my heart break and bleed.

Then I sit here and wipe away my tears
Wishing you could kiss away my fears
If only you knew how much€¦.
I miss and need your embrace and your touch

I know I can't hide from my thoughts and my fear
And I know at these times I don't seem near
But you break down these walls
With the strength of your love
And then I feel blessed
From God above!

My love for you runs so deep through my vein
That I dream of you, in spite of the pain.

Bereft of soul
My body shall be bare.
Bereft of body
My soul shall be bare.
Which would you rather have
O kind sea?
Which is the more dead
Of the two?
I throw the bodies out,
I cannot stand their smell.
Only the souls may enter
The vortex of sea.
Only the souls know how to sing
At the vortex of the sea.
Your body shall be dead,
Poor thing,
Dead as driftwood, drifting
And drifting to the shore.
Your body shall ride the tide,
Rider, slumped dead
On white war-house.
Charging.
Your body shall bruise white
Against the coral reefs,
Your body,
Your lonely body.
I tell you, sea,
I have enough courage to die,
But not enough.
Not enough to disobey him
Who said: Do not die
And hurt me that certain way.
How easy your duties are.
How simple.
Only roar a hungry roar,
Leao forward,
And retreat.
You swing and you swing,
O sea, you play a child's game.
But,
I must pose.
I must pretend,
I must act the role
Of happy woman,
Happy wife.
I must keep the right distance
Between me and the low.
And I must keep the right distance
Between me and the high.
O sea, i am fed up
I want to be simple
I want to be loved
And
If love is not to be had,
I want to be dead, just dead
While I enter deeper,
With joy I discover
The sea's hostile cold
Is after all skin-deep.
The sea's inner chambers
Are all very warm.
There must be a sun slumbering
At the vortex of the sea.
O sea, i am happy swimming
Happy, happy, happy ...
The only movement i know well
Is certainly the swim.
It comes naturally to me.
I had a house a Malabar
And a pale-green pond.
I did all my growing there
In the bright summer months.
I swam about and floated,
And divided into the cold and green
I lay speckled green and gold
In all the hours of the sun,
Until
My grandmother cried,
Darling, you must stop this bathing now.
You are much too big to play
Naked in the pond.
Yes, the only movement i really know
Is swimming,
It comes naturally to me.
The white man who offers
To help me forget,
The white man who offers
Himself as a stiff drink,
Is for me,
To tell the truth,
Only water.
Only a pale-green pond
Glimmering in the sun.
In him I swim
All broken with longing.
In his robust blood i float
Drying off my tears.
Yet i never can forget
The only man who hurts.
The only one who seems to know
The only way to hurt.
Holding you is easy
Clutching at moving water,
I tell you, sea,
This is easy,
But to hold him for half a day
Was a difficult task.
It required drinks
To hold him down.
To make him love.
But, when he did not love,
Believe me,
All I could do was to sob like a fool.
O sea,
You generous cow,
You and I are big flops.
We are too sentimental
For our own
Good.
Lights are moving on the shore.
But I shall not return.
Sea, toss my body back
That he knew how to love.
Bereft of body
My soul shall be free.
Take in my naked soul
That he knew how to hurt.
Only the soul knows how to sing
At the vortex of the sea.

Where are its shores and its bottom?
You know not the limits of this

If it were merely a pain it would
melt in limpid tears, reflecting its

159,339,"The Meaning Of Love

To love is to share life together
to build special plans just for two
to work side by side
and then smile with pride
as one by one, dreams all come true.

To love is to help and encourage
with smiles and sincere words of praise
to take time to share
to listen and care
in tender, affectionate ways.

To love is to have someone special
one who you can always depend
to be there through the years
sharing laughter and tears
as a partner, a lover, a friend.

To love is to make special memories
of moments you love to recall
of all the good things
that sharing life brings
love is the greatest of all.

I've learned the full meaning
of sharing and caring
and having my dreams all come true;
I've learned the full meaning
of being in love
by being and loving with you.

HERE, O my heart, let us burn the dear dreams that are dead, 
Here in this wood let us fashion a funeral pyre 
Of fallen white petals and leaves that are mellow and red, 
Here let us burn them in noon's flaming torches of fire. 


We are weary, my heart, we are weary, so long we have borne 
The heavy loved burden of dreams that are dead, let us rest, 
Let us scatter their ashes away, for a while let us mourn; 
We will rest, O my heart, till the shadows are gray in the west. 

But soon we must rise, O my heart, we must wander again 
Into the war of the world and the strife of the throng; 
Let us rise, O my heart, let us gather the dreams that remain, 
We will conquer the sorrow of life with the sorrow of song. ",0.0

Larry came into my bar
Every day to drink two beers.
""My brother’s dying; one’s for him,""
He said, his eyes full of tears.


Each day it was the same,
Two beers and then he’d go,
One for his brother, one for him,
He’s sad but sweet, this schmo.


One day he orders just one.
His brother’s dead, I’m thinking.

Pretence of an enveloping heavenly vault,
Royaler investiture than this massed assault
Of emerald rapture pearled with tears of dew.

Of drab brown earth and streams that never halt
In their deep murmur which white flowers strew

Floating like stars upon a strip of sky.

Than the manufactured tissue of earth's grace.

And sip from Hebe's cup nectar enough

And drop in the suffering soil of his birth
Fire-seeds of ecstasy.

And the boon of the Spirit's sight.

Mother, your baby is silly! She is so absurdly childish!
She does not know the difference between the lights in the
streets and the stars.
When we play at eating with pebbles, she thinks they are real
food, and tries to put them into her mouth.
When I open a book before her and ask her to learn her a, b,
c, she tears the leaves with her hands and roars for joy at
nothing; this is your baby's way of doing her lesson.
When I shake my head at her in anger and scold her and call
her naughty, she laughs and thinks it great fun.
Everybody knows that father is away, but if in play I call
aloud ""Father,"" she looks about her in excitement and thinks that
father is near.
When I hold my class with the donkeys that our washer man
brings to carry away the clothes and I warn her that I am the

It was hot, so hot, before the eunuchs came 
To dance, wide skirts going round and round, cymbals 
Richly clashing, and anklets jingling, jingling 
Jingling... Beneath the fiery gulmohur, with 
Long braids flying, dark eyes flashing, they danced and 
They dance, oh, they danced till they bled... There were green 
Tattoos on their cheeks, jasmines in their hair, some 
Were dark and some were almost fair. Their voices 
Were harsh, their songs melancholy; they sang of 
Lovers dying and or children left unborn.... 
Some beat their drums; others beat their sorry breasts 
And wailed, and writhed in vacant ecstasy. They 
Were thin in limbs and dry; like half-burnt logs from 
Funeral pyres, a drought and a rottenness 
Were in each of them. Even the crows were so 
Silent on trees, and the children wide-eyed, still; 
All were watching these poor creatures' convulsions 
The sky crackled then, thunder came, and lightning 
And rain, a meagre rain that smelt of dust in 
Attics and the urine of lizards and mice....

After a whole day’s grazing, you, Death,
Death, approach me with such gentle steps,
Settle yourself immovably by my side.
I cannot understand the things you say.

Alas, will this be how you will take me, Death,
Death? Like a thief, laying heavy sleep
On my eyes as you descend to my heart?
Will you thus let your tread be a slow beat
In my sleep-numbed blood, your jingling ankle-bells
A drowsy rumble in my ear? Will you, Death,
Death, wrap me, finally, in your cold
Arms and carry me away while I dream?
I do not know why you thus come and go.

Tell me, is this the way you wed, Death,
Death? Unceremonially, with no
Weight of sacrament or blessing or prayer?
Will you come with your massy tawny hair
Unkempt, unbound into a bright coil-crown?
Will no one bear your victory-flag before
Or after, will no torches glow like red
Eyes along the river, Death, Death?
Will earth not quake in terror at your step?

When fierce-eyed Siva came to take his bride,
Remember all the pomp and trappings, Death,
Death: the flapping tiger-skins he wore;
His roaring bull; the serpents hissing round
His hair; the bom-bom sound as he slapped his cheeks;
The necklace of skulls swinging round his neck;
The sudden raucous music as he blew
His horn to announce his coming - was this not
A better way of wedding, Death, Death?

And as that deathly wedding-party’s din
Grew nearer, Death, Death, tears of joy
Filled Gauri’s eyes and the garments at her breast
Quivered; her left eye fluttered and her heart
Pounded; her body quailed with thrilled delight
And her mind ran away with itself, Death, Death;
Her mother wailed and smote her head at the thought
Of receiving so wild a groom; and in his mind
Her father agreed calamity had struck.

Why must you always come like a thief, Death,
Death, always silently, at night’s end,
Leaving only tears? Come to me festively,
Make the whole night ring with your triumph, blow
Your victory-conch, dress me in blood-red robes,
Grasp me by the hand and sweep me away!
Pay no heed to what others may think, Death,
Death, for I shall of my own free will
Resort to you if you but take me gloriously.

If I am immersed in work in my room
When you arrive, Death, Death, then break
My work, thrust my unreadiness aside.
If I am sleeping, sinking all desires
In the dreamy pleasure of my bed, or I lie
With apathy gripping my heart and my eyes
Flickering between sleep and waking, fill
Your conch with your destructive breath and blow,
Death, Death, and I shall run to you.

I shall go to where your boat is moored,
Death, Death, to the sea where the wind rolls
Darkness towards me from infinity.
I may see black clouds massing in the far
North-east corner of the sky; fiery snakes
Of lightning may rear up with their hoods raised,
But I shall not flinch in unfounded fear -
I shall pass silently, unswervingly
Across that red storm-sea, Death, Death.

On the Seashore 

On the seashore of endless worlds children meet. 
The infinite sky is motionless overhead and the restless water is boisterous. On the seashore of endless worlds the children meet with shouts and dances. 
They build their houses with sand, and they play with empty shells. With withered leaves they weave their boats and smilingly float them on the vast deep. Children have their play on the seashore of worlds. 
They know not how to swim, they know not how to cast nets. Pearl-fishers dive for pearls, merchants sail in their ships, while children gather pebbles and scatter them again. They seek not for hidden treasures, they know not how to cast nets. 
The sea surges up with laughter, and pale gleams the smile of the sea-beach. Death-dealing waves sing meaningless ballads to the children, even like a mother while rocking her baby's cradle. The sea plays with children, and pale gleams the smile of the sea-beach. 
On the seashore of endless worlds children meet. Tempest roams in the pathless sky, ships are wrecked in the trackless water, death is abroad and children play. On the seashore of endless worlds is the great meeting of children.",1.0

Mother, the light has grown grey in the sky; I do not know what
the time is.
There is no fun in my play, so I have come to you. It is
Saturday, our holiday.
Leave off your work, mother; sit here by the window and tell
me where the desert of Tepantar in the fairy tale is.
The shadow of the rains has covered the day from end to end.
The fierce lightning is scratching the sky with its nails.
When the clouds rumble and it thunders, I love to be afraid
in my heart and cling to you.
When the heavy rain patters for hours on the bamboo leaves,
and our windows shake and rattle at the gusts of wind, I like to
sit alone in the room, mother, with you, and hear you talk about
the desert of Tepantar in the fairy tale.
Where is it, mother, on the shore of what sea, at the foot of
what hills, in the kingdom of what king?
There are no hedges there to mark the fields, no footpath
across it by which the villagers reach their village in the
evening, or the woman who gathers dry sticks in the forest can
bring her load to the market. With patches of yellow grass in the
sand and only one tree where the pair of wise old birds have their
nest, lies the desert of Tepantar.
I can imagine how, on just such a cloudy day, the young son
of the king is riding alone on a grey horse through the desert, in
search of the princess who lies imprisoned in the giant's palace
across that unknown water.
When the haze of the rain comes down in the distant sky, and
lightning starts up like a sudden fit of pain, does he remember his
unhappy mother, abandoned by the king, sweeping the cow-stall and
wiping her eyes, while he rides through the desert of Tepantar in
the fairy tale?
See, mother, it is almost dark before the day is over, and
thee are no travellers yonder on the village road.
The shepherd boy has gone home early from the pasture, and men
have left their fields to sit on mats under the eaves of their
huts, watching the scowling clouds.
Mother, I have left all my books on the shelf-do not ask me
to do my lessons now.
When I grow up and am bid like my father, I shall learn all
that must be learnt.
But just for today, tell me, mother, where the desert of
Tepantar in the fairy tale is.",2.0

Its happened again.

The moment when I thought nothing would go wrong,
That everything would be alright,
That there was nothing to worry about,
That everything was perfect.

But just like those other times,
It didn't last.
Another moment in life,
Another piece to the puzzle.
Slowly completing,

And showing its face.

The face that I've been longing to see.
The face I was always aware of,
The face I've been waiting for,
The face I'm conscious of.

Suddenly exposed into my eyes and heart.

I stare motionless,
Although expected, still surprised.
Calmly, patiently, warmly, silently, soothingly,
Able to realize that this is what I was sent to discover.
Sent to vividly recognize what this is all about.

Not a game but another rationally humanly way of living.
Just another part I must adjust to.
And when the end suddenly appears,
Ill be proud to say that I learned something in life.
Proud to say that I learned something thanks to you.

Proud to say I saw the face and learned about it.

Proud to say that that face was introduced by you,
Fed by you,

I must launch out my boat. 
The languid hours pass by on the 
shore---Alas for me! 

The spring has done its flowering and taken leave. 
And now with the burden of faded futile flowers I wait and linger. 

The waves have become clamorous, and upon the bank in the shady lane 
the yellow leaves flutter and fall. 

What emptiness do you gaze upon! 
Do you not feel a thrill passing through the air 
with the notes of the far-away song 
floating from the other shore?",0.0

Stuck In The Past,

Old memories, old actions, old regrets,
It seems someone never forgets,
They seem to return over and over again,
When will they disappear, 
when when when...

Why are the details so important,
They aren't even related to us,
Do they really have to add up,
or have to be continuous?

Feels like being stuck in the past,
am curious to how long it will last,
It eats away the present o so fast,
that even our future will become the past.

I was at home watching TV
flicking the channels what could I see
lady gaga got an award and as she got out of her seat
I was amazed she was wearing a dress made of meat
I thought if its good for gaga its good for me
I was down the butchers by half past three
stood at the counter clothes round my feet
I said have you something to fit me that's stylish and neat
he held up a chipolata cheeky sod
hey this is what I was gifted from god
well I got pork chops for pants and rump for a hat
turkey trousers and a sausage cravat
when he was finished I minced down the street
walking on kidneys made for my feet
but soon in the heat I started to foam
then I walked passed the stray dog home
well there was chaos I tried to run
as German Sheppard pulled the steak from my bum
a sausage dog grabbed my sausage a basset my chops
it was such chaos I emptied the shops
so my friends if a meat dress your tempted to make
take it from me its a big big mis- steak.

197,272,"Touch

Have you ever tried meditation?
Struggling hard to concentrate,
and keeping your mind as blank
as a whitewashed wall by closing
your eyes, nose, ears; and shutting out
every possible thought. Every thing.
And, the only failure, that ever came,
the only gross betrayal—
was from your own skin.
                    You will have known this.

Do you still remember,
how, the first distractions arose?
And you blamed skin as a sinner;
how, when your kundalini was rising,
shaken, you felt the cold concrete floor
skin rubbing against skin, your saffron robes,
how, even in a far-off different realm—
your skin anchored you to this earth.
Amidst all that pervading emptiness,
touch retained its sensuality.
                    You will have known this.

Or if you thought more variedly, about
taste, you would discount it—as the touch
of the tongue. Or, you may recollect
how a gentle touch, a caress changed
your life multifold, and you were never
the person you should have been.
Feeling with your skin, was
perhaps the first of the senses, its
reality always remained with you—
You never got rid of it.
                    You will have known this.

You will have known almost
every knowledgeable thing about
the charms and the temptations
that touch could hold.

But, you will never have known
that touch – the taboo
to your transcendence,
when crystallized in caste
was a paraphernalia of
undeserving hate.

Oh my soul, be thou quiet
This is not 'another diet'
Just a program of exchange
Though some things do seem strange

Raw vegetables and 'brock-o-lee'
Does not sound too good to me
Lots of tofu and bean sprouts
While my empty stomach shouts

The meaning here is quite plain;
This program is designed for pain
Someone with anorexia planned
A program that tastes like sand

My hands are sweating, my soul is dreading
I must keep this thing from spreading
My only hope, the paper shredder

201,1014,"Monkey In The Middle

There once was a monkey in a city’s zoo,
who dreamed of the outside sun.
He did like hitting kids with poo,
but he felt that that’s been done.

So he climbed out in the middle of night, 
and explored through the cities streets.
He stopped when it was turning light 
And felt he wanted to eat.

That poor monkey needed cash 
to afford his exotic meals.
But his stomach led him to the trash,
where he ate a cube of butter and apple peels.

If he wanted to eat, he needed a job,
to pay for the food on his tummy.
So he asked many snobs,
but each time he left without money.

He tried to be an actor,
but found out he couldn't sing or cry.
He had the smarts to be a politician,
but found out he couldn't lie.

None one wanted his application.
No one gave him a chance.
Some were scared because he was from another nation.
Other because he didn’t own pants.

He only found one job, 
that paid food and shelter instead of wages.
All he was asked to do,
was to sit inside steel cages,
and dream of the outside sun.

How Dare you do this to me.
How Dare you stand there and let us be.
You not wanting this marriage and working late is how this began.
I now know this has to end.
I have a responsibility to be strong and be there for our boys.
They are human they are not toys.
They want-they need their dad
instead of wishing and being sad.
How dare you do this to me and I go on and let this be.
How dare you stay married to be all these years
and stand back and watch my tears.
I know you don't want me and I know this much is true
I am stronger now instead of being blue.
To tell you the truth I don't care anymore
your lies and you I no longer stand for or adore.
You stole my heart-my pride-my soul
you are not a human you are just cold.
You don't love me or want to be married -I don't know how many times I have to be told
but I realize now you were being you just bitter and cold.
How dare you do this to me and stand there and let this be.
Do you feel pain or are you just mad
for once in your cold life I want you to feel sad.
Payback is hell and that is what you deserve and I hope you will feel pain and unwanted everyday in everyway.
How dare you do this to me-I have to let go and I now know this is how it has to be. 
I will eventually need to pack up and leave. 
When we say our goodbyes
I will be drying my eyes.
How dare you wanting to leave
I just have to realize we were never meant to be.

204,186,"Cop Contest

A dispute among three kinds of cops,
CIA, FBI, LAPD:
Who can catch bad guys the quickest?
We'll set up a contest and see.


A rabbit was set loose in the trees;
""We'll get him first,"" they all said.
They gathered up all of their gear,
And into the forest they sped.


The CIA with informants,
Questions animals and plants on its list,
And after four months investigation,
Concludes rabbits do not exist.


The FBI searches and searches,
But can't find a single clue.
After three weeks they burn down the forest,
Killing the poor bunny, too.


The LAPD takes an hour;
Solving crimes fast is their habit.
Their perp is a badly bruised cougar,
Shouting, ""Whatever you say! I'm a rabbit!""",1.0

You've changed my life completely
the day that you were born.
Never knew how wonderful it would be,
to explore motherhood.
But since I got the chance to
I have to confess and say,
that I was so scared to hold you
always thought that you would break
cause you were so tiny an fragile
there was no thinking twice
but as time went on
you got bigger every moment
and the next thing I knew
is you were trying to crawl and walk
there were times when you'd fall and cry
but I would dry them tears
and you would get right back up and try again
Just thinking and looking back at the past
I've figured out
that seeing you and those cute little faces you make
is what gets me through each day
I'm so happy your here little sis
I love you very much
and nothing will ever change that.

209,673," In what state was I

by Darshan Singh

English version by Barry Lerner and Harbans Singh Bedi
Original Language Urdu

Who knows, in what state was I when I met her eyes?
Where, who was I? Completely lost.

For you that sun and that moon are gaudy snares:
Beware, lest caught, your gaze rise no higher.

My love -- the paradise at my journey's end -- is annoyed.
Why does every path seem so lonesome?

Impetuous tipplers, have regard for the goblets and cups!
As you journey through the world of hearts, step gently.

My madness knows why, nightlong, desperate with sorrow,
I rush about with tearful eyes, embracing shadows.

I follow no guide, no creed -- just an inkling of the way:
A tug at my heart leads me forward.

Friends, we must not let the darkness enshroud us again!
So many kissed the gallows before we saw this dawn.

When beauty herself provokes a look, therein lies the thrill:
Were she not so expectant, what would compel my eyes?

Darshan, life is the confluence of reality and dream:
In this union lies the exaltation of a human being.

And you see the two-crows-for-joy-pass that are sitting on
overhead cables and the evening moon,
a mere silvery slice against fluffy translucent sky.

And the remains of your school where you spent your twelve
longest years and lived through everything.

And the bus-stand you had to draw for your art-class in yellow
ochre or asphalt grey and the emptiness that now occupies the
place where a tiny café once stood.

And the tree where they fed you lunch before you learnt to walk
back home. And I thought of my parents.

Brilliant people talking of the intricacies of their life and the corruption of
morals and the bygone days and hunger in their childhood and their deaddear-
departed parents as if to teach you what to talk to your children.

(And you are their child,
so you speak their lines.)
Still returning home,

And there are rusty mammoth girders that outline the sky like
the derelicts of lost dreams and crossed hopes.

And girls so flimsy pretty yet unsafe in the little worlds of lip
gloss and love affairs that you could have smoked them into
oblivion.

And the dry decaying dead leaves crushed with varying noises
and carrying a spent smell that clings to your hair.

And the shy forest noises that violate your fixation over sight
and sound and smell and touch yes touch.

And I thought of my lover.

A primitive man who would invade
your aloneness on insomniac nights
and challenge your assumptions of
love and your sophistications and fill
your ears with the four letter words of
his ancient language that have begun
to sound to you like earth songs to
which your body awakens.

(And you are his love,
so you listen to his lines.)

On the way home, the small
lessons you learn of life. . .
Love, or the promise of love,
its lack of choice.
This large world.
And its littleness.

220,550,"Famous Funny Poem by Alfred Noyes

Everyone grumbled. The sky was grey.
We had nothing to do and nothing to say.
We were nearing the end of a dismal day,
And then there seemed to be nothing beyond,
Then
Daddy fell into the pond!

And everyone's face grew merry and bright,
And Timothy danced for sheer delight.
""Give me the camera, quick, oh quick!
He's crawling out of the duckweed!"" Click!

Then the gardener suddenly slapped his knee,
And doubled up, shaking silently,
And the ducks all quacked as if they were daft,
And it sounded as if the old drake laughed.
Oh, there wasn't a thing that didn't respond
When
Daddy Fell into the pond!

221,319,"This Dog
Every morning this dog, very attached to me,
Quietly keeps sitting near my seat
Till touching its head
I recognize its company.
This recognition gives it so much joy
Pure delight ripples through its entire body.
Among all dumb creatures
It is the only living being
That has seen the whole man
Beyond what is good or bad in him
It has seen
For his love it can sacrifice its life
It can love him too for the sake of love alone
For it is he who shows the way
To the vast world pulsating with life.
When I see its deep devotion
The offer of its whole being
I fail to understand
By its sheer instinct
What truth it has discovered in man.
By its silent anxious piteous looks
It cannot communicate what it understands
But it has succeeded in conveying to me
Among the whole creation
What is the true status of man.

My horse is there in front of me
Clip-cloppin' down the road.
He stops and flips his tail straight up
And drops another load.

My cows dump in the meadow,
My chickens foul their coop,
And flies are buzzin' 'round and 'round
Eatin' all that poop.

The sheep are out there bleatin'...
I gotta' get a grip!
The stupid things are standin'
Knee-deep in their dip!

I swear on this here farm
There's every barnyard species,
And each and every one of them
Is makin' tons of feces.

I'm tired of smellin' livestock.
I'd like to take a nap.
But I can't sleep 'cause I dream of
Hogs wallowin' in their crap.

Now my wife is in the kitchen
Cookin' soup du jour,
But nothin' smells real good to me;
I'm surrounded by manure.

So now he has had his eyes done, 
and at last he can see,

but I was a bit worried, 
what would he think of me?

You see, he hadn't seen me, 
out of two good eyes,

would I be a total shock, 
or a nice surprise?

He said ""my God, you are almost grey, 
you're eyes are much too small,

you are old and fat and ugly,
I'm not impressed at all""

But as I sat there crying, 
I suddenly noticed that---

he wasn't looking my way,
but talking to the cat!!

so yes I think he's very pleased 
with all that he can see

He thinks every thing is lovely, 
and that includes me!!

An Indian Love Song

He

Lift up the veils that darken the delicate moon 
of thy glory and grace,
Withhold not, O love, from the night 
of my longing the joy of thy luminous face,
Give me a spear of the scented keora 
guarding thy pinioned curls, 
Or a silken thread from the fringes 
that trouble the dream of thy glimmering pearls;
Faint grows my soul with thy tresses' perfume 
and the song of thy anklets' caprice,
Revive me, I pray, with the magical nectar 
that dwells in the flower of thy kiss.

She 

How shall I yield to the voice of thy pleading, 
how shall I grant thy prayer,
Or give thee a rose-red silken tassel, 
a scented leaf from my hair?
Or fling in the flame of thy heart's desire the veils that cover my face,
Profane the law of my father's creed for a foe 
of my father's race?
Thy kinsmen have broken our sacred altars and slaughtered our sacred kine,
The feud of old faiths and the blood of old battles sever thy people and mine.

He

What are the sins of my race, Beloved, 
what are my people to thee? 
And what are thy shrines, and kine and kindred, 
what are thy gods to me?
Love recks not of feuds and bitter follies, 
of stranger, comrade or kin,
Alike in his ear sound the temple bells 
and the cry of the muezzin.
For Love shall cancel the ancient wrong 
and conquer the ancient rage,
Redeem with his tears the memoried sorrow 
that sullied a bygone age.

225,360,"Lover's Gifts XLII: Are You a Mere Picture 

Are you a mere picture, and not as true as those stars, true as
this dust? They throb with the pulse of things, but you are
immensely aloof in your stillness, painted form.
The day was when you walked with me, your breath warm, your
limbs singing of life. My world found its speech in your voice, and
touched my heart with your face. You suddenly stopped in your walk,
in the shadow-side of the Forever, and I went on alone.
Life, like a child, laughs, shaking its rattle of death as it
runs; it beckons me on, I follow the unseen; but you stand there,
where you stopped behind that dust and those stars; and you are a
mere picture.
No, it cannot be. Had the life-flood utterly stopped in you,
it would stop the river in its flow, and the foot-fall of dawn in
her cadence of colours. Had the glimmering dusk of your hair
vanished in the hopeless dark, the woodland shade of summer would
die with its dreams.
Can it be true that I forgot you? We haste on without heed,
forgetting the flowers on the roadside hedge. Yet they breathe
unaware into our forgetfulness, filling it with music. You have
moved from my world, to take seat at the root of my life, and
therefore is this forgetting-remembrance lost in its own depth.
You are no longer before my songs, but one with them. You came
to me with the first ray of dawn. I lost you with the last gold of
evening. Ever since I am always finding you through the dark. No,
you are no mere picture.

To which Time's splendid gains are hoarded dross;

Is a pale illusion by some greater voice
And mightier vision; no sweet sound or word,
No passion of hues that make the heart rejoice

Why do you sit there on the floor so quiet and silent, tell me,
mother dear?
The rain is coming in through the open window, making you all
wet, and you don't mind it.
Do you hear the gong striking four? It is time for my brother
to come home from school.
What has happened to you that you look so strange?
Haven't you got a letter from father today?
I saw the postman bringing letters in his bag for almost
everybody in the town.
Only father's letters he keeps to read himself. I am sure the
postman is a wicked man.
But don't be unhappy about that, mother dear.
Tomorrow is market day in the next village. You ask your maid
to buy some pens and papers.
I myself will write all father's letters; you will not find
a single mistake.
I shall write from A right up to K.
But, mother, why do you smile?
You don't believe that I can write as nicely as father does!
But I shall rule my paper carefully, and write all the letters
beautifully big.
When I finish my writing do you think I shall be so foolish
as father and drop it into the horrid postman's bag?
I shall bring it to you myself without waiting, and letter by
letter help you to read my writing.
I know the postman does not like to give you the really nice
letters.",0.0

You may have thought I didn't see,
Or that I hadn't heard,
Life lessons that you taught to me,
But I got every word.


Perhaps you thought I missed it all,
And that we'd grow apart,
But Dad, I picked up everything,
It's written on my heart.


Without you, Dad, I wouldn't be
The (woman)(man) I am today;
You built a strong foundation
No one can take away.

And I'm very glad I did;
So here's to you, dear father,
From your forever grateful kid.

I had always been the odd one out, in this world of people who seemed to be better than me. I could always hope that one day I would be accepted, but now a days, that hope has turned into misery.

I turned to my best friend and I said; ""Harry, I'm scared, I can't do it, they would hurt me if I said it.""

He just looked at me and frowned and said; ""You need to learn to stand your ground, Teagan, you're a tough girl you're a fighter, who cares about the unwanted fire.""

When Harry said unwanted fire, he meant the heated arguments between my parents.

""All you need to do is be brave, and you'll be on your way."" 

""But I'm not brave like you Harry!""

""You are in your own way.""

I went home that night befuddled by what Harry had said, it didn't explain anything, it made no sense in my head.

My mum saw me from outside, and came out shouting about the time of night.

""Do you know what time it is? I was so worried."" she would say, but it was only an act, I knew she didn't care, she continues to tell me what a waste of space I am, and that she wasted her money when she adopted me.

""I don't care."" I said, as I walked past her, I aimed for the door, and next thing you know, I get slapped in the face, it stings for awhile and I turn around, to see another frown.

""Now listen to me, do as I say, I know what's right, and from this day, you will not stay out late, you will come home early, you are not the type of girl who wanders the street!""

Me being the smart arse I am had to reply which earned me another slap and a Punch from behind.

""Technically, it is not day, it is night, so your instruction means nothing what so ever, now leave me be!""

Now, my story lays in the hands of the sequel of my soul, and even though you're dead now Harry, here's my message to you, ""Harry, I'm scared, I am sorry, but I cannot be brave, when I'm filled with worry, I know your story, but you don't know mine, but I think it's time I told you, I was adopted, I was raped, and abused, my parents hurt me in so many ways, these memories will stay with me to my dying days, Harry I miss you, I don't know what to do, I know what your would say to me now, you would say; ""Yep, your screwed.""

I love you Harry, you will always be my best friend, no one will ever replace you, you were right, I can be brave, in my own way, by telling this short story of mine, and publishing it for the world to see, I hope your proud of me. xx

253,861,"Love and war
two thousand years ago
our word for love
was the same.

women and men
wrote their songs of love
the intimacies of inside

and they spoke of how
love was tireless
love was a fantasy feast
love was no disease
love was no evil goddess
love was a harshness, in the parting
love was
             ‘the thing that made a girl’s bangles
             slip loose when her lord went away
             grow tight when her lord returned’
love was (they sang)
             ‘bigger than the earth
             higher than the sky
             unfathomable than the waters.’
love was.

no names were named.
you did not know
             who he was
             or who she was
             or when it was
             or where it was
only
love was.

and there were
the poems of war,
the war poetry
poems on the outside

(and perhaps
because the bards
wore lotuses of gold)

there are
the poems
where the names were named
where the kings were praised
where a bard addressed another
where the guide sang to the patron
where the poet sang to the courtesan
where mothers spoke of tigers in their wombs
where the kingdom was
             ‘an unfailing harvest of
             victorious wars’
where the old women
             ‘threatened to slash their breasts
             if their sons died in battle with backs

             ‘the blood glowing
             in the red center of the battlefield

love never has an end.

254,174,"Me and Laughter Together Always  

Sometimes I laugh out loud
Showing you that I could care less what you have to say
All that matters is that my feelings are hidden
Hiding from those who judge me and those who love me
And Laughter helps me do just that
Laughter is my better half
Laughter stands with me when I’m bored
Laughter comforts me when I want to cry
He keeps me company through grief and through happiness
For better or worse, in sickness and health, through thick and thin
I love Laughter and Laughter loves me back
And yet you don’t know why Laughter makes Me 
Look deep into my eyes when I laugh and you’ll see
You will find all the hate, all the pain, and all the hurt
But if that’s all you see
You’re not looking deep enough
Look past the tears that I won’t allow to flow
Look past the memories that I can’t let go of
And when you see through all the hate, all the pain and all the hurt
You'll find Me
I cover Me up with Laughter
There are none who can see the true Me
They can’t see through my Laughter
And if you should happen to see Me
I won’t need Laughter to hide anymore
Because I can cry on your shoulder
I can smile and enjoy you company without a single sound
Only then, Laughter won’t be my protector
Until then, it’s Me and Laughter together always
I hide my feelings through Laughter
So if you’re trying to figure out what I’m thinking, 
Laugh with me and you will then see...-Me

One day in spring, a woman came
In my lonely woods,
In the lovely form of the Beloved.
Came, to give to my songs, melodies,
To give to my dreams, sweetness.
Suddenly a wild wave
Broke over my heart's shores
And drowned all language.
To my lips no name came,
She stood beneath the tree, turned,
Glanced at my face, made sad with pain,
And with quick steps, came and sat by me.
Taking my hands in hers, she said:
'You do not know me, nor I you—
I wonder how this could be?'
I said:
'We two shall build, a bridge for ever
Between two beings, each to the other unknown,
This eager wonder is at the heart of things.'

The cry that is in my heart is also the cry of her heart;
The thread with which she binds me binds her too.
Her have I sought everywhere,
Her have I worshipped within me,
Hidden in that worship she has sought me too.
Crossing the wide oceans, she came to steal my heart.
She forgot to return, having lost her own.
Her own charms play traitor to her,
She spreads her net, knowing not
Whether she will catch or be caught.

they only cause me strife

Your self-expression surely stinks
of mouldy day-old eel

To sing of magic wonders
is nothing but pure ****e
 
Your metaphors are useless,
your imagery is vile
Your sense of diction makes me gag,
I cannot stand your ""style""
 
So save me your quotations,
please spare me all your rhyme
Shove that poem up your rear
and cease to waste my time

laughter in its echoing shade and if 
the end of no saffron mantle flutters
in the wind; if its silence is not
deepened by soft whispers.

268,203,"The Godfather

An Italian family that lives near me
had a welcome addition to their family
And for miles around with vino and grins
happy folk celebrated the birth of twins.

So proudly their father named Anthony -
well he was Italian, what else could it be?
Gave serious thought to who he would rather
honour his family by being Godfather.

Though he'd lived in Australia all of his days
still he respected the old country's ways.
Standing beside his new babies asleep,
he thought of the custom he wanted to keep.

The honour in store could go to no other,
The choice of tradition was Bruno, his brother.
Bruno, of course, he had Italian blood too,
with pride in his heart knew the things he must do.

He gathered the forms; saw all was in order;
to register the births just like he oughta
And he felt like a king around ten feet tall
as he fronted the man at the local town hall.

He said he was there to register the twins
""And now I'm an uncle,"" he said between grins.
The man at the counter, a typical Norm,
said, ""Well let's see what you've done with these forms ....""

He looked at the forms and said, ""Don't play games! 
Do this thing properly! You've left out their names.
I'll fill it in then you can leave me in peace.
What do you call the girl?"" Bruno said, ""Denise!""

As Norm looked up you might think he approved.
There's even a remote chance he was moved.
He said, ""Did the boy get called something too?""
Bruno replied, ""Of course! He's da nephew!""

Suicide tempts me every time I swallow, 
all because this destructive life lead, 
and the paths I follow. 
I'm invisible to myself,

Many never believed me, 
others always dared. 
Hurting everyone whomever had my back. 
The only way I deserve to leave this world is in a black polyester sack. 
My life, 
what life, 
is all down the drain,

I'm sorry everyone, 
I'm sorry for all I've done, 
but the pain will end now, 
it will all end once I'm gone. 
A slice to wrist, 
a cut to the throat, 
sleeping pills for the pain hallucinating of being afloat. 
Lifting to the heaven that I could only dream, 
blood dripping from my torso like melting ice cream. 
No breath, 
no life, 
no soul, 
I'm sorry mom,
I'm sorry dad,

But six years have come and gone.

But you were oh so wrong.

I think you can probably tell.

Don't ever try to make things right,
They'll never be the same.

You can just forget my name.

The stupid things are standin'
Knee-deep in their dip!

I swear on this here farm
There's every barnyard species,
And each and every one of them
Is makin' tons of feces.

I'm tired of smellin' livestock.
I'd like to take a nap.
But I can't sleep 'cause I dream of
Hogs wallowin' in their crap.

Now my wife is in the kitchen
Cookin' soup du jour,
But nothin' smells real good to me;
I'm surrounded by manure.

In the village they call her the dark girl
but to me she is the flower Krishnakali
On a cloudy day in a field
I saw the dark girl's dark gazelle-eyes.
She had no covering on her head,
her loose hair had fallen on her back.

Dark? However dark she be,
I have seen her dark gazelleeyes.

Two black cows were lowing,
as it grew dark under the heavy clouds.
So with anxious, hurried steps,
the dark girl came from her hut.
Raising her eyebrows toward the sky,
she listened a moment to the clouds' rumble.

Dark? However dark she be,
I have seen her dark gazelle-eyes.

A gust of the east wind
rippled the rice plants.
I was standing by a ridge,
alone in the field.
Whether or not she looked at me
Is known only to us two.

Dark? However dark she be,
I have seen her dark gazelle-eyes.

This how the Kohldark cloud
rises in the northeast in Jaistha;
the soft dark shadow
descends on the Tamal grove in Asharh;
and sudden delight floods the heart
in the night of Sravan.

Dark? However dark she be,
I have seen her dark gazelle-eyes.

To me she is the flower Krishnakali,
whatever she may be called by others.
In a field in Maynapara village
I saw the dark girl's dark gazelle-eyes.
She did not cover her head,
not having the time to feel embarrassed.

Dark? However dark she be,
I have seen her dark gazelle-eyes.

Music is silenced, the dark descending slowly
Has stripped unending skies of all companions.
Weariness grips your limbs and within the locked horizons
Dumbly ring the bells of hugely gathering fears.
Still, O bird, O sightless bird,
Not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings.


It's not melodious woodlands but the leaps and falls
Of an ocean's drowsy booming,
Not a grove bedecked with flowers but a tumult flecked with foam.
Where is the shore that stored your buds and leaves?
Where the nest and the branch's hold?
Still, O bird, my sightless bird,
Not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings.

Stretching in front of you the night's immensity
Hides the western hill where sleeps the distant sun;
Still with bated breath the world is counting time and swimming
Across the shoreless dark a crescent moon
Has thinly just appeared upon the dim horizon.
—But O my bird, O sightless bird,
Not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings.


From upper skies the stars with pointing fingers
Intently watch your course and death's impatience
Lashes at you from the deeps in swirling waves;
And sad entreaties line the farthest shore
With hands outstretched and crooning 'Come, O come!'
Still, O bird, O sightless bird,
Not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings.


All that is past: your fears and loves and hopes;
All that is lost: your words and lamentation;
No longer yours a home nor a bed composed of flowers.
For wings are all you have, and the sky's broadening countryard,
And the dawn steeped in darkness, lacking all direction.
Dear bird, my sightless bird,
Not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings!",0.0

She stood there by the ocean,
The breeze gently lifted her hair.
Of that seagull just above her,
She was totally unaware.

Seemingly floating in the sky,
The seagull’s wings were still.
I think it paused to take good aim,
And drop a mess at will.

Too late she looked above her head,
Where the seagull hovered now.
Then as I watched in horror,
Bird droppings hit her brow.

Her scream pierced the balmy air.
Splat! The stuff hit her face.
Then she saw my camera and me,
And stomped off in disgrace.

Leaving behind others to take your place,
Carrying on your name, walking around with your face,
Knowing you go left behind,
Wondering what's on my fathers mind.
He didn't even think to try.
To leave my mother with tears going down her face,
Left me only to embrace,
Only for me to ask her why?
My mother can give me answers;
My father left behind.
For he can give his love to another,
But can't give his love to me,
My mother would give her life,
As she's given life to me,
My father I hope to love.
Will he ever really love me?
He can take and make a life and keep living on,
But what is it like to live without a father,
He doesn't even know,
Because he doesn't even care,

Married a man who murdered thirteen men and one

Through layers of khaki, and golden white skin to spill
The bloodied guts of a British soldier who tried to colonize her. . .

For so long It had to hide

Pain surrounds me day by day
It just doesn't seem to go away

Pain that comes and pain that goes
Pain that keeps you on your toes

There is pain in my heart
And it seems to never part

Pain stuffed inside of me

Can't let anyone see the real me
Can't let anyone even hug me

294,554,"Devote Your Life to Money

Oh, money, the life-giving juice of society!
It brings us its blessings of every variety,
It softens the blows that lifetime delivers,
It favors the brave and it crowns achievers.

It renders us free from oppression by jerks,
From mockings, and putdowns, and scoldings,and smirks.
It lets us buy tickets and travel away
From where we're not welcome but are forced to just stay.

From creditors' letters and big ugly urbs,
From all that don't matter, from stuff that disturbs,
To wide sandy beaches and azure blue waters,
Away from the smoke of ten million motors.

With money it all starts to fall into place-
No longer respect is what you have to chase.
It follows you like an afternoon shadow
Thank money, it makes you a prince from a padow.

With money, all people will treat you much better,
As you are no longer society's debtor.
Sweet smiles on you they will now bestow,
Obsequious looks in their eyes then will glow.

And women forgetting your age and your weight,
Your looks and your height and your bald, shining pate,
Will wink and remark how handsome you are
For, in their minds, you are now a star.

Oh, how pathetic society is!
A ""Miss"" is now where there used to be ""Ms.""
For quickly they learned that you've got all this dough,
And then they appear from above and below.

For freedom, for joy and enjoyment of senses,
Don't waste precious time chasing empty pretenses.
Just line up your pockets with luscious green money
And soon you'll be hugging a cute Playboy bunny.

As long as you're here on our green Earth,
And want to be living in freedom and mirth,
Devote your existence to dollar and pound
For cash makes the world go smoothly around.

Marks across my face,
From where he had hit me,

Bruises on my back,
The blood courses through my veins,
In this dark old room,
There is something untamed.
Scared to say a word,
Just one word to come out,
For no one knows what happens when the beast has made his rounds.
People always stare at me,
I now know what they say,
For all these scars left on my wrist,
The past has been revealed.

So no blood runs through these veins

Arisen to voiceless unattainable peaks
I meet no end, for all is boundless He,
An absolute Joy the wide-winged spirit seeks,
A Might, a Presence, an Eternity.

In the inconscient dreadful dumb Abyss
Are heard the heart-beats of the Infinite.
The insensible midnight veils His trance of bliss,
A fathomless sealed astonishment of Light.

In His ray that dazzles our vision everywhere,
Our half-closed eyes seek fragments of the One:
Only the eyes of Immortality dare
To look unblinded on that living Sun.

Yet are our souls the Immortal's selves within,
Comrades and powers and children of the Unseen.",0.0

DEIGN, Prince, my tribute to receive, 
This lyric offering to your name, 
Who round your jewelled scepter bind 
The lilies of a poet's fame; 
Beneath whose sway concordant dwell 
The peoples whom your laws embrace, 
In brotherhood of diverse creeds, 
And harmony of diverse race:

The votaries of the Prophet's faith, 
Of whom you are the crown and chief 
And they, who bear on Vedic brows 
Their mystic symbols of belief; 
And they, who worshipping the sun, 
Fled o'er the old Iranian sea; 
And they, who bow to Him who trod 
The midnight waves of Galilee.

Sweet, sumptuous fables of Baghdad 
The splendours of your court recall, 
The torches of a Thousand Nights 
Blaze through a single festival; 
And Saki-singers down the streets, 
Pour for us, in a stream divine, 
From goblets of your love-ghazals 
The rapture of your Sufi wine.


Prince, where your radiant cities smile, 
Grim hills their sombre vigils keep, 
Your ancient forests hoard and hold 
The legends of their centuried sleep; 
Your birds of peace white-pinioned float 
O'er ruined fort and storied plain, 
Your faithful stewards sleepless guard 
The harvests of your gold and grain.

God give you joy, God give you grace 
To shield the truth and smite the wrong, 
To honour Virtue, Valour, Worth. 
To cherish faith and foster song. 
So may the lustre of your days 
Outshine the deeds Firdusi sung, 
Your name within a nation's prayer, 
Your music on a nation's tongue.

Even though
We’re far apart
You’ll always be
In our heart

He loved you then
We love you now
Kept from your life
We don’t know how

Perhaps one day
A chance we’ll be given
Until that time
You’ll be missed where we’re liven

We’ll hope for the best
But expect the worst
That you’ll change your mind
For this we’ll thirst

Whether you do or don’t
We may never know
But never forget
We still love you so

Your touch a cool caress

And dream of you each night

304,876,"My Pain

My pain feels like bones breaking,
Day after day.
I feel so stressed and tired,
that my hair may turn gray.
I keep on crying,
like an old tissue tatty and wear.
What if I don't get better,
That is my biggest fear.
I feel so dizzy, like I might fall down,
but no matter what my family has been around.
However lately I feel like I might give up,
as I have so many pills that they could fill up a cup.
This year hasn't been so great for me,
and not for a lot of my family.
My grandma is forgetting simple things,
like who she is and what she brings.
My uncle and best friend have cancer,
I wish somehow that they will both find the answer.
These horrible things are making me mad,
I love them so much it makes me sad.
Believe me I'm not trying to make it all about me,
I just don't know the last time my pain was a three.
All I've been getting is nines and nines,
there's no way this pain is in my mind.
Without god I would not be here,
he saved my life this year.
The pain is only a small price to pay,
as I wish to walk with my lord someday

308,329,"She 

She who ever had remained in the depth of my being, 
in the twilight of gleams and of glimpses; 
she who never opened her veils in the morning light, 
will be my last gift to thee, my God, folded in my final song. 

Words have wooed yet failed to win her; 
persuasion has stretched to her its eager arms in vain. 

I have roamed from country to country keeping her in the core of my heart, 
and around her have risen and fallen the growth and decay of my life. 

Over my thoughts and actions, my slumbers and dreams, 
she reigned yet dwelled alone and apart. 

Many a man knocked at my door and asked for her 
and turned away in despair. 

There was none in the world who ever saw her face to face, 
and she remained in her loneliness waiting for thy recognition.

309,927,"Punishment in Kindergarten

Today the world is a little more my own.
No need to remember the pain
A blue-frocked woman caused, throwing
Words at me like pots and pans, to drain
That honey-coloured day of peace.
‘Why don't you join the others, what
A peculiar child you are! '

On the lawn, in clusters, sat my
schoolmates sipping
Sugarcane, they turned and laughed; 
Children are funny things, they laugh
In mirth at others' tears, I buried
My face in the sun-warmed hedge
And smelt the flowers and the pain.

The words are muffled now, the laughing
Faces only a blur. The years have
Sped along, stopping briefly
At beloved halts and moving
Sadly on. My mind has found
An adult peace. No need to remember
That picnic day when I lay hidden
By a hedge, watching the steel-white sun
Standing lonely in the sky.

311,913,"Love So Pure

its sweet like the nectar
of the garden flower,
its soothing like the buzzing
of a bumble bee,
its warm like the rays
of the morning sun,
its the search of a love so pure 
which keeps me on the run.

its the pulse in my vein,
the thoughts in my brain,
in every breath that I take,
the smile my lips make,
its in the twinkle of my eye,
till the day I die.

its the dream in my sleep,
its springs freshest leaf;
a love so rare like this 
will always be with me for keeps.

its the warmth of my blood,
as my feelings flood,
as says my heart's beat,
its depth touches the ocean's feet.

even if its heart searing pain,
with nothing to gain,
I will feel it as the tear on my cheek,
and without words my soul will speak.

a feeling so sincere,
a bond so strong,
I know my soul will never guide me wrong.

I will wait till my last sunset,
till my heart slows down with a dull ache,
till my eyes are wet,
till I meet my soul's mate,

313,152,"Learning My Lesson

I gave you a chance, let you in and tried to be your friend,
I should have known, you wouldn’t be there in the end.

I wanted you to love me, I waited for so very long,
I didn’t want to feel the hurt, but you still did me wrong.

I always had hope, I never wanted it this way,
No matter how hard I tried, You always pushed me away.

I should have known, You never really cared,
You let us leave, You were never even scared.

We never turned back, your own brother helped us board.
Never caring what was ahead, through it all we sure soared.

There were times, whether good or bad,
When I was a little girl, I should of had my dad.

You weren’t there when I was young, You never got to see,
You don’t have a clue, You don’t even know me.

Every single birthday, They all went by,
You never saw those candles go out, never my dad by my side.

But you should know, I had someone there,
He’s special to me, and his name is Ger.

But not even him can take away, all these years of pain, 
Through all of this hurt, there is still a lot to gain.

Without even knowing, you taught me good lessons for life,
I will do what I can, because my husband deserves a good wife.

I will stick by his side, never let things go bad.
Because I have chosen a man, who will always be a good dad.

You have made me wise, much more than my years,
All this hurt and pain, I have learned a lot through the tears.

I have been so mature, much more than even you,
What can I say, I guess you didn’t know what to do.

You think I don’t know, maybe it’s I didn’t want to,
But me being younger, I will always be more mature than you.

I stand up for myself, believe in what I say,
And always know, I treat people the right way.

There is no more to say, nothing more I can do.
Any chance of a relationship for us, is now and forever through.

You threw that away, many years ago with the lies,
Funny thing though the truth, you must know, it never dies.

The truth is that she doesn't have, 
but what she needs to know

This life she leads leaves so much space 
for seeds that need to grow

What happened then, before this time, 
how did it come to be?

That she would find herself 
so hurt and longing to be free

The stories told do not ring true 
to what's inside her head

Why can't she live each day with joy, 
not such an aching dread?

When will the past come forth 
to show her how it all began?

324,611,"Lover's Gifts LXX: Take Back Your Coins 

Take back your coins, King's Councillor. I am of those women you
sent to the forest shrine to decoy the young ascetic who had never
seen a women. I failed in your bidding.
Dimly day was breaking when the hermit boy came to bathe in
the stream, his tawny locks crowded on his shoulders, like a
cluster of morning clouds, and his limbs shining like a streak of
sunbeam. We laughed and sang as we rowed in our boat; we jumped
into the river in a mad frolic, and danced around him, when the sun
rose staring at us from the water's edge in a flush of divine
anger.
Like a child-god, the boy opened his eyes and watched our
movements, the wonder deepening till his eyes shone like morning
stars. He lifted his clasped hands and chanted a hymn of praise in
his bird-like young voice, thrilling every leaf of the forest.
Never such words were sung to a mortal woman before; they were like
the silent hymn to the dawn which rises from the hushed hills. THe
women hid their mouths with their hands, their bodies swaying with
laughter, and a spasm of doubt ran across his face. Quickly came
I to his side, sorely pained, and, bowing to his feet, I said,
""Lord, accept my service.""
I led him to the grassy bank, wiped his body with the end of
my silken mantle, and, kneeling on the ground, I dried his feet
with my trailing hair. When I raised my face and looked into his
eyes, I thought I felt the world's first kiss to the first woman, 
-Blessed am I, blessed is God, who made me a woman. I heard him say
to me, ""What God unknown are you? YOur touch is the touch of the
Immortal, your eyes have the mystery of the midnight.""
Ah, no, not that smile, King's Councillor, -the dust of
worldly wisdom has covered your sight, old man. But this boy's
innocence pierced the mist and saw the shining truth, the woman
divine....
The women clapped their hands, and laughed their obscene
laugh, and with veils dragged on the dust and hair hanging loose
they began to pelt him with flowers.
Alas, my spotless sun, could not my shame weave fiery mist to
cover you in its folds? I fell at his feet and cried, ""Forgive me.
"" I fled like a stricken deer through shade and sun, and cried as
I fled, "" Forgive me. "" The women's foul laughter pressed me like
a cracking fire, but the words ever rang in my ears, "" What God
unknown are you?""",0.0

I still remember the first day we met 
We were too shy to say much at all 
It's funny to think back to that time 
Because now we're having a ball! 

They say that true friendship is rare 
An adage that I believe to be true 
Genuine friendship is something that I cherish 
I am so lucky to have met you. 

Our bond is extremely special 
It is unique in it's own way 
We have something irreplaceable 
I love you more and more each day. 

We've been through so much together 
In so little time we've shared 
I will never forget all the moments 
That you've shown me how much you cared. 

Friends are forever 
Especially the bond that you and I possess 
I love your fun-filled personality 
Somehow you never fail to impress. 

The world could use more people like you 
It would certainly be a better place 
I love everything about you 
You are someone I could never replace. 

You are always there for me 
When my spirits need a little lift 
I cannot thank you enough for that 
You are truly an extraordinary gift. 

You are everything to me and more 
I could never express that enough 
Life is such a treacherous journey, and 
Without you it would be even more tough. 

Our story will continue to grow 
With each passing day 
Because I trust that with you by my side 
Everything will always be Okay. 

You are so dear to me 
You know I will love you until the end 
I will always be there for you, and 
You will always (and forever) be my best friend

WHEN dawn's first cymbals beat upon the sky, 
Rousing the world to labour's various cry, 
To tend the flock, to bind the mellowing grain, 
From ardent toil to forge a little gain, 
And fasting men go forth on hurrying feet, 
Buy bread, buy bread, rings down the eager street. 


When the earth falters and the waters swoon 
With the implacable radiance of noon, 
And in dim shelters koïls hush their notes, 
And the faint, thirsting blood in languid throats 
Craves liquid succour from the cruel heat, 
Buy fruit, buy fruit, steals down the panting street.


When twilight twinkling o'er the gay bazaars, 
Unfurls a sudden canopy of stars, 
When lutes are strung and fragrant torches lit 
On white roof-terraces where lovers sit 
Drinking together of life's poignant sweet, 
Buy flowers, buy flowers, floats down the singing street.

332,411,"The Gardener IX: When I Go Alone at Night 

When I go alone at night to my
love-tryst, birds do not sing, the wind
does not stir, the houses on both sides
of the street stand silent.
It is my own anklets that grow loud 
at every step and I am ashamed.
When I sit on my balcony and listen
for his footsteps, leaves do not rustle
on the trees, and the water is still in
the river like the sword on the knees
of a sentry fallen asleep.
It is my own heart that beats wildly
--I do not know how to quiet it.
When my love comes and sits by
my side, when my body trembles and
my eyelids droop, the night darkens,
the wind blows out the lamp, and the
clouds draw veils over the stars.
It is the jewel at my own breast
that shines and gives light. I do not
know how to hide it.

Thy face is bent from above, thy eyes look down on my eyes,

If thou speakest not I will fill my heart with thy silence and endure it. 
I will keep still and wait like the night with starry vigil 
and its head bent low with patience. 

The morning will surely come, the darkness will vanish, 
and thy voice pour down in golden streams breaking through the sky.

335,342,"The Horse Ride

Taking a romantic ride today,
We sat upon the wagon.
Suddenly the horse lifted his tail
And we heard a roaring dragon!

The deafening sound hurt my ears
And the smell burned the hairs in my nose.
My girlfriend sat and glared at me.
Somehow my fault I suppose.

It was my idea to take the ride,
But how was I to know?
It really wasn’t in my plans;
Didn’t know the horse would blow.

The noise and the smell were bad enough,
As the wind blew quickly by.
But I think the very worst of it,
Was the brown stuff in my eye.

My girlfriend’s face turned angry red.
So I figured I wouldn’t dare,
Advise her of the smelly pieces
Of horse stuff in her hair.

The horse finally stopped; my girl ran away,
Stubbornly lifting her chin.
I think that horse was enjoying himself,
Cause I’m sure I saw him grin. 

A lesson learned for me today.
Although I must confess,
I laughed so hard I nearly cried
As I wiped away the mess.

The Banyan Tree 

O you shaggy-headed banyan tree standing on the bank of the pond,
have you forgotten the little chile, like the birds that have
nested in your branches and left you?
Do you not remember how he sat at the window and wondered at
the tangle of your roots and plunged underground?
The women would come to fill their jars in the pond, and your
huge black shadow would wriggle on the water like sleep struggling
to wake up.
Sunlight danced on the ripples like restless tiny shuttles
weaving golden tapestry.
Two ducks swam by the weedy margin above their shadows, and
the child would sit still and think.
He longed to be the wind and blow through your resting
branches, to be your shadow and lengthen with the day on the water,
to be a bird and perch on your topmost twig, and to float like
those ducks among the weeds and shadows.

And I got your words
Today.

I will have them painted
Tonight.

Try to choose
Or take them all.

Glitter on innocent
Raspberry lips that plead
For touch, for closer
Communion.

Composition in coffee
Cream blending with bitter
Chocolate worn on business
Days.

Ravenous red, for fiery
Animals in us, tamed,
By love in dying
Languages.

Colourless words, invisible
But everywhere—Love
Reserved for needy
Nights.

Love, remember the rain
And our fading words
On lonely nights
Drenching—Drizzling—

Silence.

Which still linger on lips.

Remember that some words
Which once beheld promise

by Darshan Singh

English version by Barry Lerner and Harbans Singh Bedi
Original Language Urdu

How did I ever think silence the language of love?
What I thought would not come to light was in plain sight.

I hear my silence talked of in every lane;
The suppression of a cry is itself a cry of pain.

The beloved's regard was but a flash of light;
How innocent to think I'd found eternal bliss.

These, too, in the end were the gardener's: the lightning and the wind
And that handful of pitiful straws I'd called my nest.

Darshan, the glances I'd fancied voiced my love --
Even they couldn't convey the unplumbed depths of my longing.",2.0

I have got my leave. Bid me farewell, my brothers! 
I bow to you all and take my departure. 

Here I give back the keys of my door 
---and I give up all claims to my house. 
I only ask for last kind words from you. 

We were neighbors for long, 
but I received more than I could give. 
Now the day has dawned 
and the lamp that lit my dark corner is out. 
A summons has come and I am ready for my journey.

Flower by Rabindranath Tagore
Pluck this little flower and take it, delay not! I fear lest it 
droop and drop into the dust. 

I may not find a place in thy garland, but honour it with a touch of 
pain from thy hand and pluck it. I fear lest the day end before I am 
aware, and the time of offering go by. 

Though its colour be not deep and its smell be faint, use this flower 
in thy service and pluck it while there is time.",0.0

347,423,"How they prostitute a poem

It is uniquely easy
For some to sell
Ideals because
Business of absent
Goods is essentially
A sacrosanct but mostly
A flimsy transaction.

Some learn, early on,
To prostitute their verse.
So, in all the waking hours
They scavenge for a simple simile
That matches requirements, fulfills needs.

They barter reality
And every romance
To a blurred triplicate
Carbon-copy World of Hard
Cash and Price Tags and Brand Names.

In this brothel
Of stilled hope and
Stagnated stories, poems
Are born virgin and endowed
With voluptuous figures of firm,
Full breasts and wide hips where men
Prefer to plant their pastime dreams,
Or conceive their seed,
Or merely spite themselves,
Or dabble at domination.

But, the poem, with this
Bogus existence becomes
An adept, untiring prostitute.

Taken
On a starry night,
The poem opens
(dry and drab and dreary:
lacking love and life) like
The paid-for parting
Of the thighs.

but can’t because I’m expected to be a perfect little girl

afraid of what people might think

and no one knows it
people in my family even try to hide it
but they raised a smart girl
and I know everything

but soon enough

and they better be prepared for what emerges
what conflicts I’ll cause
what family disagreements will occur

The Gardener XLII: O Mad, Superbly Drunk 

O mad, superbly drunk;
If you kick open your doors and
play the fool in public;
If you empty your bag in a night, 
and snap your fingers at prudence;
If you walk in curious paths and
play with useless things;
Reck not rhyme or reason;
If unfurling your sails before the
storm you snap the rudder in two,
Then I will follow you, comrade,
and be drunken and go to the dogs.
I have wasted my days and nights
in the company of steady wise neighbours.
Much knowing has turned my hair
grey, and much watching has made 
my sight dim.
For years I have gathered and
heaped up scraps and fragments of
things:
Crush them and dance upon them,
and scatter them all to the winds.
For I know 'tis the height of wisdom
to be drunken and go the dogs.
Let all crooked scruples vanish,
let me hopelessly lose my way.
Let a gust of wild giddiness come
and sweep me away from my anchors.
The world is peopled with worthies,
and workers, useful and clever.
There are men who are easily first,
and men who come decently after.
Let them be happy and prosper, 
and let me be foolishly futile.
For I know 'tis the end of all works
to be drunken and go to the dogs.
I swear to surrender this moment
all claims to the ranks of the decent.
I let go my pride of learning and
judgment of right and of wrong.
I'll shatter memory's vessel, scattering
the last drop of tears.
With the foam of the berry-red
wine I will bathe and brighten my 
laughter.
The badge of the civil and staid
I'll tear into shreds for the nonce.
I'll take the holy vow to be worthless,

Love is for those who care 
hate is for those who hate
friends are those who will be there till the end
parents are those to say never be late
You said you loved me because you cared
but at the same time you said you hated me
as long as your there i will never leave
Why do u make me mad
Make me sad? 
Make me cry? 
Make me wanna die? 
You say u love me
then u play games with my heart
and eventually tear it all
you said u would always love me 
I thought it was true
but all it was was u being you
I will always love you no matter what
this may be true
even though u always turn me blue.

If baby only wanted to, he could fly up to heaven this moment.
It is not for nothing that he does not leave us.
He loves to rest his head on mother's bosom, and cannot ever
bear to lose sight of her.
Baby know all manner of wise words, though few on earth can
understand their meaning.
It is not for nothing that he never wants to speak.
The one thing he wants is to learn mother's words from
mother's lips. That is why he looks so innocent.
Baby had a heap of gold and pearls, yet he came like a beggar
on to this earth.
It is not for nothing he came in such a disguise.
This dear little naked mendicant pretends to be utterly
helpless, so that he may beg for mother's wealth of love.
Baby was so free from every tie in the land of the tiny
crescent moon.
It was not for nothing he gave up his freedom.
He knows that there is room for endless joy in mother's little
corner of a heart, and it is sweeter far than liberty to be caught
and pressed in her dear arms.
Baby never knew how to cry. He dwelt in the land of perfect
bliss.
It is not for nothing he has chosen to shed tears.
Though with the smile of his dear face he draws mother's
yearning heart to him, yet his little cries over tiny troubles
weave the double bond of pity and love.",1.0

by Nazrul Islam

English version by John Thorpe
Original Language Bengali

In Garden Plot, O Nightingale, do not
rock upon this flower stem today;
For these buds swinging in deep sleep,
Unbroken dozing slumber lay.

Oh how north winds blow now!
Empty branches bow, day and night!
Absent is the southern breeze,
singing melodies, honey bees are in dismay!

When will that virgin flower
sunder sleeps power, opening wide in blossom?
By morning cheeks in red, breaking slumber's stay. 

Springtime wakes the bud wide,
breaking each side, bringing a flowering flood.
Flowering bud's, parting lips pursed
into laughter burst, dimpled cheeks display.

Oh poet! you forgot the scent, so
sinking down low, fail to find that shore.
The flower in past, that had filled your breast,
Now, o'erflowed it lies, 'neath a flood of watering eyes.",0.0
358,197,"She Wears My Shoes

She rode on my wings, 
shared her dreams, 
and lit my life with such a glow.
I was her protector, teacher and friend, 
and will be her mother until my end 
I made a lot of mistakes not knowing the cost in the end, 
I never intended to hand down the same shoes my mother handed me. 
But I see that is what I did. 
And crushing all her dreams. 
It has been over four years since we have last spoken, 
but never a day passes that I don't send my love to the stars above, 
and ask for an Angel to open up their wings 
and take my place and guide her to follow all her dreams. 
She will always have a place in my heart that will never be replaced, 
This is how a mothers love was always meant to be.
I hope that someday our paths will cross again, 
and I can hold her in my arms 
and tell her I understand better than she could ever know
I understand what I did in passing the shoes to her.
If I could take it all back, believe me I would.
But, for now it’s out of my hands.

And what shoulder, and what art,

They did this to her, the men who know her, the man
She loved, who loved her not enough, being selfish
And a coward, the husband who neither loved nor
Used her, but was a ruthless watcher, and the band
Of cynics she turned to, clinging to their chests where
New hair sprouted like great-winged moths, burrowing her
Face into their smells and their young lusts to forget
To forget, oh, to forget, and, they said, each of
Them, I do not love, I cannot love, it is not
In my nature to love, but I can be kind to you.
They let her slide from pegs of sanity into
A bed made soft with tears, and she lay there weeping,
For sleep had lost its use. I shall build walls with tears,
She said, walls to shut me in. Her husband shut her
In, every morning, locked her in a room of books
With a streak of sunshine lying near the door like
A yellow cat to keep her company, but soon
Winter came, and one day while locking her in, he
Noticed that the cat of sunshine was only a
Line, a half-thin line, and in the evening when
He returned to take her out, she was a cold and
Half dead woman, now of no use at all to men.

stream of the world.
Our lives will be carried apart, and our love forgotten.
But I am not so foolish as to hope that I could buy your heart
with my gifts.
Young is your life, your path long, and you drink the love we
bring you at one draught and turn and run away from us.
You have your play and your playmates. What harm is there if
you have no time or thought for us!
We, indeed, have leisure enough in old age to count the days
that are past, to cherish in our hearts what our hands have lost

374,665,"Complicated Families...

So many tears shed in the dark of night,
hidden away in our private thoughts
only to be shelved with morning's first light
because of no courage to speak of the pain
this part of our lives remain the same...

Mother's and Fathers, Sisters and Brothers
gather for holidays they hope will heal
while gathered together sharing a meal
what they bring, back from the past,
perhaps they'll be able to bed it, at last.

Years of analysis, a lifetime of good,
can be shattered with just one word,
maybe a look, or gesture of scorn;
any of which destroys years of progress,
all the good overturned,
At least that's what I'm told,
over and over again...

I sit by a letter, addressed to my sister,
no courage to post it, no guts to muster.
I've written the things I needed to say;
will she get my meaning or stray away?
into her own thoughts to calm her that day...
thoughts of comfort, truth not portrayed.

It must be nice to be the favored child of choice,
to not know the feelings of a life not rejoiced,
to know through life, whatever wrong you've done
in the eyes of the parents, you'll remain number one;
to not know what it's like to give of your soul
for recognition that you will never, ever know...

I MUSE among these silent fanes 
Whose spacious darkness guards your dust; 
Around me sleep the hoary plains 
That hold your ancient wars in trust. 

I pause, my dreaming spirit hears, 
Across the wind's unquiet tides, 
The glimmering music of your spears, 
The laughter of your royal brides. 

In vain, O Kings, doth time aspire 
To make your names oblivion's sport, 
While yonder hill wears like a tier 
The ruined grandeur of your fort. 

Though centuries falter and decline, 
Your proven strongholds shall remain 
Embodied memories of your line, 
Incarnate legends of your reign. 

O Queens, in vain old Fate decreed 
Your flower-like bodies to the tomb; 
Death is in truth the vital seed 
Of your imperishable bloom 

Each new-born year the bulbuls sing 
Their songs of your renascent loves; 
Your beauty wakens with the spring 
To kindle these pomegranate groves.

Ours is a silence
that waits. Endlessly waits.

And then, unable to bear it
any further, it breaks into wails.

But not all suppressed reactions
end in our bemoaning the tragedy.

Sometimes,
the outward signals
of inward struggles takes colossal forms
And the revolution happens because our dreams explode.

Most of the time:

Aggression is the best kind of trouble-shooting.

I once applied for a life online
Sadly however, I was declined
They told me I was not eligible
So I wrote them a letter to complain
They sent it back, it was not legible
So on with my search for a life
This has given me a bit of strife
I don't have enough money or any good looks
I can't paint a picture or write a book
I can barley chew gum and walk at the same time
I can even be quiet enough to become a mime

This love older than I by myriad
Saddened centuries was once a prayer
In his bones that made them grow in years of
Adolescence to this favored height; yes,
It was my desire that made him male
And beautiful, so that when at last we
Met, to believe that once I knew not his
Form, his quiet touch, or the blind kindness
Of his lips was hard indeed. Betray me?
Yes, he can, but never physically
Only with words that curl their limbs at
Touch of air and die with metallic sighs.
Why care I for their quick sterile sting, while
My body's wisdom tells and tells again
That I shall find my rest, my sleep, my peace
And even death nowhere else but here in

ONCE in the dream of a night I stood 
Lone in the light of a magical wood, 
Soul-deep in visions that poppy-like sprang; 
And spirits of Truth were the birds that sang, 
And spirits of Love were the stars that glowed, 
And spirits of Peace were the streams that flowed 
In that magical wood in the land of sleep.


Lone in the light of that magical grove, 
I felt the stars of the spirits of Love 
Gather and gleam round my delicate youth, 
And I heard the song of the spirits of Truth; 
To quench my longing I bent me low 
By the streams of the spirits of Peace that flow 
In that magical wood in the land of sleep.

Flaming green of a morning that awaits rain
    And my lover speaks of rape through silences,
    Swallowed words and the shadowed tones
    Of voice. Quivering, I fill in his blanks.
Green turns to unsightly teal of hospital beds
    And he is softer than feathers, but I fly away
    To shield myself from the retch of the burns
    Ward, the shrill sounds of dying declarations,
The floral pink-white sad skins of dowry deaths.

Open eyes, open hands, his open all-clear soul . . .

Colorless noon filters in through bluish glass
    And coffee keeps him company. She chatters
    Away telling her own, every woman’s story;
    He listens, like for the first time. Tragedy in
Bridal red remains a fresh, flushing bruise across
    Brown-yellow skinscapes, vibrant but made
    Muted through years of silent, waiting skin.
    I am absent. They talk of everyday assault that
Turns blue, violet and black in high-color symphony.

Open eyes, open hands, his open all-clear soul . . .

Blues blend to an unforgiving metropolitan black
    And loneliness seems safer than a gentle night
    In his arms. I return from the self-defence lessons:
Mistrust is the black-belted, loose white mechanism
    Of survival against this groping world and I am
    A convert too. Yet, in the way of all life, he could try
And take root, as I resist, and yield later, like the earth.

Open eyes, open hands, his open all-clear soul . . .
Has he learnt to live my life? Has he learnt never to harm?

Laughter  

Laughter is a pleasant sound, it spreads joy all around
Whether you're young or old, laughter can be like
Magic to our souls, whenever we're feeling sad
Laughter can sustain us so that things don't seem
Quite so bad, if we give into laughter, it can be like
A cure for something that seems impossible to endure
So any time your spirits need a lift fill yourself
With laughter and you will find, a much happier
Person with a peaceful frame of mind

My love, I have tried with all my being
to grasp a form comparable to thine own,
but nothing seems worthy; 
I know now why Shakespeare could not
compare his love to a summer’s day.
It would be a crime to denounce the beauty
of such a creature as thee,
to simply cast away the precision
God had placed in forging you.

Each facet of your being
whether it physical or spiritual
is an ensnarement
from which there is no release.
But I do not wish release.
I wish to stay entrapped forever.
With you for all eternity.

We left that old ungainly house
When my dog died there, after
The burial, after the rose
Flowered twice, pulling it by its
Roots and carting it with our books,
Clothes and chairs in a hurry.
We live in a new house now,
And, the roofs do not leak, but, when
It rains here, I see the rain drench
That empty house, I hear it fall
Where my puppy now lies,

Where the clustering keovas guard the squirrel's slumber, 
Where the deep woods glimmer with the jasmine's bloom?

I'll feed thee, O beloved, on milk and wild red honey, 
I'll bear thee in a basket of rushes, green and white, 
To a palace-bower where golden-vested maidens 
Thread with mellow laughter the petals of delight.

Day by day I float my paper boats one by one down the running
stream.
    In big black letters I write my name on them and the name of
the village where I live.
    I hope that someone in some strange land will find them and
know who I am.
    I load my little boats with shiuli flower from our garden, and
hope that these blooms of the dawn will be carried safely to land
in the night.
    I launch my paper boats and look up into the sky and see the
little clouds setting thee white bulging sails.
    I know not what playmate of mine in the sky sends them down
the air to race with my boats!
    When night comes I bury my face in my arms and dream that my
paper boats float on and on under the midnight stars.
    The fairies of sleep are sailing in them, and the lading ins
their baskets full of dreams.

I dreamt death came the other night
And heaven's gate swung wide;
With kindly grace an angel came
To usher me inside.

Yet there to my astonishment
Stood folks I'd known on earth,
Some I had judged as quite unfit
Or of but little worth.

Indignant words rose to my lips
But never were set free;
For every face showed stunned surprise
NO ONE expected me!

Thou who art the innermost Spirit of my being,
art thou pleased, Lord of my Life?
For I give to thee my cup filled with all
the pain and delight that the crushed
grapes of my heart had surrendered,
I wove with rhythm of colors and song cover for thy bed,
And with the molten gold of my desires
I fashioned playthings for thy passing hours.
I know not why thou chosest me for thy partner,
Lord of my life.

Didst thou store my days and nights,
my deeds and dreams for the alchemy of thy art,
and string in the chain of thy music my songs of autumn and spring,
and gather the flowers from my mature moments for thy crown?

I see thine eyes gazing at the dark of my heart,
Lord of my life,
I wonder if my failure and wrongs are forgiven.
For many were my days without service
and nights of forgetfulness; futile were the flowers
that faded in the shade not offered to thee.

Often the tied strings of my lute slackened
at the strains of thy tunes.
And often at the ruin of wasted hours
my desolate evenings were filled with tears.

But have my days come to their end at last,
Lord of my life, while my arms round thee
grow limp, my kisses losing their truth?
Then break up the meeting of this languid day!
Renew the old in me in fresh forms of delight;
and let the wedding come once again in
a new ceremony of life.

410,340,"Love, Laughter, And You  


 
Three things that make my life complete
Are love, laughter, and you, my sweet
The laughter has lasted since day one
Loving you darling, has been so much fun

Whether it's giggles at the kitchen table
Or all out laughter wherever we're able
Each and every laugh, a symbol of our love
You're my everything, all I ever dreamt of

Our love, now that's a bit more serious
Shining through when our laughter is delirious
Starting the day with love's tenderness
Saying goodnight with a sweet caress

Love, laughter, and of course you.
You bring into my life the other two
From the day we met, and for every single day
Love and laughter in our lives will stay

Art thou abroad on this stormy night 
on thy journey of love, my friend? 
The sky groans like one in despair. 

I have no sleep tonight. 
Ever and again I open my door and look out on 
the darkness, my friend! 

I can see nothing before me. 
I wonder where lies thy path! 

By what dim shore of the ink-black river, 
by what far edge of the frowning forest, 
through what mazy depth of gloom art thou threading 
thy course to come to me, my friend?",5.0

The sparkle in your eye,
The warmth of your skin.
Your breath on my neck,
That shakes me within.

The touch of your hand,
The smell of your hair.
The naughtiness in your smile,
That strength in your stare.

Your kiss on my lips,
Your body near mine.
The stroke of your touch,
That feeling inside.

The Compassion in your embrace.
The power in your face.
The beating of your heart.
That we may never part

The beauty of your kiss,
and that magic in your touch.
It is for all these reasons and more,
Why I love you so much……….

Whosever room this is should be ashamed!
His underwear is hanging on the lamp.
His raincoat is there in the overstuffed chair,
And the chair is becoming quite mucky and damp.
His workbook is wedged in the window,
His sweater's been thrown on the floor.
His scarf and one ski are beneath the TV,
And his pants have been carelessly hung on the door.
His books are all jammed in the closet,
His vest has been left in the hall.
A lizard named Ed is asleep in his bed,
And his smelly old sock has been stuck to the wall.
Whosever room this is should be ashamed!
Donald or Robert or Willie or--
Huh? You say it's mine? Oh, dear,
I knew it looked familiar!

In noon-tide hours, O Love, secure and strong, 
I need thee not; mad dreams are mine to bind
The world to my desire, and hold the wind
A voiceless captive to my conquering song.
I need thee not, I am content with these:
Keep silence in thy soul, beyond the seas!

But in the desolate hour of midnight, when
An ectasy of starry silence sleeps 
And my soul hungers for thy voice, O then,
Love, like the magic of wild melodies,
Let thy soul answer mine across the seas. ",2.0

Stream Of Life

The same stream of life that runs through my veins night and day 
runs through the world and dances in rhythmic measures. 

It is the same life that shoots in joy through the dust of the earth 
in numberless blades of grass 
and breaks into tumultuous waves of leaves and flowers. 

It is the same life that is rocked in the ocean-cradle of birth 
and of death, in ebb and in flow. 

I feel my limbs are made glorious by the touch of this world of life. 
And my pride is from the life-throb of ages dancing in my blood this moment

When I fell in love my heart was on fire 
To be with you was my one desire
And if you love me I’ll give you everything you need 
A lifetime of promises and a world full of dreams 
For only my heart knows what it means 
And I promise you it won’t be wrong 
One love, two hearts we will make it strong,
But now my love is lost in your sweet kiss 
Honey when I’m alone you’re the one I miss
And your sweet, tender love it hard to resist
Darling it's true my heart has fallen in love with you 
Looking upon the stars tonight wishing with all my might
Hoping someday you will realize this passion I hold inside
Honey it doesn’t cost a dime. 
And if you give in your love could be mine
I feel truly blessed for this feeling the Lord has given me
Accompany by faith and much understanding
And I know this gift will guide me for all eternity
As my heart fly by with angel wings 
And the clouds form into wedding rings
A woman in love the angels sing 
On and on a soft melody
That’s how it feels to be in love like me.
For thoughts from the heart are never ending

Her body glistens in the light
I urge to play with her all night
I pick her up and hold her steady
Take a deep breath, we both are ready.

I run one hand up her long neck
Just touching her makes me euphoric
Across her body, my right hand goes
I've been practicing, believe me, it shows.

Her body glistens in the light
I urge to play with her all night
I pick her up and hold her steady
Take a deep breath, we both are ready.

Another deep breath, the tension mounts
Have to stay focused, every moment counts
I am ready lets get movin'
Here it goes, we both start groovin'.

Her body glistens in the light
I urge to play with her all night
I pick her up and hold her steady
Take a deep breath, we both are ready.

I start out slow to get in the swing
As I do she starts to sing
The sounds and feelings grow more immense
The movements, become more intense.

Her body glistens in the light
I urge to play with her all night
I pick her up and hold her steady
Take a deep breath, we both are ready.

She screams and screams, while I am gropin'
My heart stops as I see the door open
My mom walks in and with a frown
Says, Your guitar is too loud, please turn it down.

About your hearts like billows on the deep 
In flames of amber and of amethyst.

Till some resistless hour shall rise and move 
Your hearts to wake and hunger after love, 
And thirst with passionate longing for the things 
That burn your brows with blood-red sufferings.

LORD BUDDHA, on thy Lotus-throne, 
With praying eyes and hands elate, 
What mystic rapture dost thou own, 
Immutable and ultimate? 
What peace, unravished of our ken, 
Annihilate from the world of men? 

The wind of change for ever blows 
Across the tumult of our way, 
To-morrow's unborn griefs depose 
The sorrows of our yesterday. 
Dream yields to dream, strife follows strife, 
And Death unweaves the webs of Life.

For us the travail and the heat, 
The broken secrets of our pride, 
The strenuous lessons of defeat, 
The flower deferred, the fruit denied; 
But not the peace, supremely won, 
Lord Buddha, of thy Lotus-throne. 

With futile hands we seek to gain 
Our inaccessible desire, 
Diviner summits to attain, 
With faith that sinks and feet that tire; 
But nought shall conquer or control 
The heavenward hunger of our soul. 

The end, elusive and afar, 
Still lures us with its beckoning flight, 
And all our mortal moments are 
A session of the Infinite. 
How shall we reach the great, unknown 
Nirvana of thy Lotus-throne?

434,516,"Sun in the mouth

And the truth scorches and singes
the pink open flesh of your mouth
with its pungent yellow taste, so,
speaking the truth is not so easy
with just one tongue, anyway.

Seeing might have been closest
to truth and as Plotinus said
the eye would not be able to see
the sun if it was itself not sun
and so seeing was understanding.

The Egyptians called the eye
with the circle of the iris
with the pupil in the centre
as the sun in the mouth
and that was their truth.

Cyclops must have had little
to see in this vast world and
deprived of the whole truth
and that was his loss, his tragedy.

Even Argus with all his eyes
couldn’t escape in the end.
How much truth, how many eyes
of how many senses would it take
to tell the truth to the lord of the third-eye?

A king of a Tamil temple city
raged mad to know the truth
of the scent of a woman’s hair.
Since money bought truth
he made ready, a thousand gold coins.

And a poor poet still married to faith
prayed on to Shiva, the lord of struggling
survivors, lord of births and lives and
deaths, lord of poor poets who gave him
a poem to be sung at the king’s court.

A savant there picked a mistake like
peeling the scab of a healed wound
and said that the poem was wrong.
He said that any woman’s hair
did not have a natural scent.

The lord of dances and grey ash
and cremation grounds came down
to challenge this stubborn man who
extended his truth, even if the woman
was the consort of the lord.

He would not budge even if the lord
threatened to open his third eye,
the eye in the forehead which would
reduce him to bone-white ashes
as light as the wispiest clouds.
The court cowered in fright. . .

But in arrogance the savant said
a mistake is a mistake
even if it was the lord
of the forehead-eye.

O’ saint-bard and master of many wily words
What do you know of truth or love,
or the scent of a woman’s hair?
On the nights of naked sky and
a fragile quarter moon, my lord,
he of the deep blue throat,
he of the rivers in his hair,
he of the third-eye, comes to me.
Before he tears the blankness
of my womb, before he traces
the length of my spine, the curve
of my thighs, before he strokes
my cheeks, he buries his head
in the thousand and one nights
of my long tresses and he says
it smells like the wind-lost voices
of his childhood summers.

When there was no strength left, 
And where the hell are you now?

Where were you when I stayed up and cried myself to sleep each night,

Where will you turn when the tables turn?

by Darshan Singh

English version by Barry Lerner and Harbans Singh Bedi
Original Language Urdu

How should I tell of the feeling that reigns in the court of the friend?
Dancing light is my beloved's face, cup and carafe are ecstatic!

Every nook and cranny is effulgent with his light;
Every mote and grain celebrates the beloved's face.

On earth from end to end I see his beauty,
In heaven after heaven I gaze upon my friend.

Seeker banished from the beatific vision, look through the eyes of your heart!
How can you see the beloved's light with eyes of flesh and blood?

Man's sorrows I bore, this world I loved --
My whole life I gave to the work of my friend.

Brushing past me, it stirred my heart and was gone:
God! The morning breeze has learned to tease from my friend.

Let them try to imprison him in temple, mosque and church!
The seeing eye finds the beloved's signs in every mote.

Very near your heart are seekers of your vision;
Those who look at the surface are exiled from the beloved's light.

What can I say of the grace he showers on me within?

Time will not pause or tarry on his way;
To-day that seems so long, so strange, so bitter,
Will soon be some forgotten yesterday.

Nay, do not weep; new hopes, new dreams, new faces,
The unspent joy of all the unborn years,
Will prove your heart a traitor to its sorrow,
And make your eyes unfaithful to their tears. ",0.0

You're the reason I get up to face each hectic day
How did our lives get so consumed with nonsense on the way
We used to take the time to laugh and play a game or two
But now it seems we fight a lot and cry way too much too
So when you go to sleep at night I'll slip in by your side
I'll hold you close and squeeze you tight and feel amazing pride
You're the one that I love best, it's very clear to see
With every day I know I'm blessed that you're a part of me
Now let's just try to slow it down and savor all that's past
For that's what molds our future, and life moves way too fast

and hours ache with songs unsung.""
It says, ""Come to me across the worn-out track of age, through
the gates of death. For dreams fade, hopes fail, the fathered

This lice lotion best of brands,
Nought point nought between the prongs,
Not short hair, but two foot long.

Eyes all bloodshot, red and stinging.
Don’t be silly, don’t start to wine,
Mummy’s got to be cruel to be kind.

Still got to get rid of that terrible stink.
Back to school, back to civilization.

Every moment we spent together
Has touched our lives, our souls forever
The things that we shared and learned
Is permanent growth that we've earned.

The person that I have grown into today
Did not get there by chance, no way
I am who I am partly because of you
And you are YOU because of me, too

The changes I see
and what I have learned about me
are a response to how we affected our lives
and what we discover in each others eyes.

It is uncertain if we have to part or one day live together 
Either way, we have touched our lives forever!
No matter what the future will show
No matter what we are told.

We are connected on such a deep levels
That no one can remove that, not even the devil.
Our feelings might be different a year from now
But you are part of me forever somehow

A part of me will always be you 
and a part of you will always be me. 
no matter what happens ,that much is certain 
our souls are one until life closes the curtain.

I will love your forever
For worse or for better

You are tattooed in my heart 
And nothing can tear our souls apart.

I will never forget you
For my love is honest and true.

I have gathered my dreams in a silver air
Between the gold and the blue
And wrapped them softly and left them there,
My jewelled dreams of you.

I had hoped to build a rainbow bridge
Marrying the soil to the sky
And sow in this dancing planet midge
The moods of infinity.

But too bright were our heavens, too far away,
Too frail their ethereal stuff;
Too splendid and sudden our light could not stay;
The roots were not deep enough.

He who would bring the heavens here
Must descend himself into clay
And the burden of earthly nature bear
And tread the dolorous way.

Coercing my godhead I have come down
Here on the sordid earth,
Ignorant, labouring, human grown
Twixt the gates of death and birth.

I have been digging deep and long
Mid a horror of filth and mire
A bed for the golden river’s song,
A home for the deathless fire.

I have laboured and suffered in Matter’s night
To bring the fire to man;
But the hate of hell and human spite
Are my meed since the world began.

a shiver through the rippling water
and sweeps away to the shadowy

It came to me like the bird of the
evening that hurriedly flies across the
lampless room from the one open 
window to the other, and disappears
in the night.
You are hidden as a star behind the

Two months into love and today I turn into a whore
Hunting for words, tearing them out from soiled sheets
Of mind or pinching them from the world like removing
Jade-green flecks from tiger’s eyes. . . And poetry refuses
Entry into my mirrored life that is bequeathed to him.

I try the mad-woman’s antics: I have pulled my hair and
Bruised my thin wrists and bit the insides of my cheeks till
They have bled a warm red sourness and I have starved
In arrogance to call the words home to me and thrown up
To clear me of him but he, strong dark man, refuses to budge,

Give way or take leave. My dark nights of savage tears have
Gone in search of needy shores deserting me (with the devil
Of a lover who sleeps half-a-dozen streams apart) and so
Have the words that once made me the sad lone woman
I was, and pretended to be. I am happy now he says and

I nod, like a Tanjore doll in breeze, and reply in cloying tones
This is happiness. I know I do not indulge in lies or delusion but
This is happiness and happiness is a hollow world for fools to
Inhabit, where all the dreams eventually die by coming to life.
Love has smothered me to a gay inertia and I long for a little

Hurt and pain that will let me scream and I wait for offending
Words to row me into worlds where I shall cry wildly for whole
Nights like the lament of lonely, old and greying seas. . . Then
Sadness shall come back with its dancing fairy lights and nail me
To wailing crosses. . . Poetry, in the end, shall replace all of him.

464,107,"My Grandmother's House

There is a house now far away where once
I received love……. That woman died,
The house withdrew into silence, snakes moved
Among books, I was then too young
To read, and my blood turned cold like the moon
How often I think of going
There, to peer through blind eyes of windows or
Just listen to the frozen air,
Or in wild despair, pick an armful of
Darkness to bring it here to lie
Behind my bedroom door like a brooding
Dog…you cannot believe, darling,
Can you, that I lived in such a house and
Was proud, and loved…. I who have lost
My way and beg now at strangers' doors to
Receive love, at least in small change?

465,82,"Could I ever forget him

by Lalan

English version by Deben Bhattacharya
Original Language Bengali

Could I ever forget him
since I delivered my heart
at his feet?
His beauty enchants my eyes
round the compass
wherever I steer myself.

Though all call him black,
He is not black.
He is the glow of the moon--
the black moon,
and there is no other moon to equal him....

One of a kind this cheerful sound
A child's laughter wherever it's found
From the giggling of a baby in a playpen
To the laughter of a toddler again and again

A child's laughter can bring a smile
To one who hasn't done so in such a long while
I know because that one was me
Until my daughter's laugh set mine free

A child's laughter so gleeful and pure
An innocence adults miss for sure
Laughter that can bring back the past
And memories of a youth that flew by so fast

A child's laughter can bring out the best
Of most any man when he's depressed
Cause his spirit that's fall to soar
Until at last he laughs once more

You don’t know if you are yielding or resisting

it is the last day of the year
and you think about writing
a farewell poem for the year
that was, for the year you
began writing poetry

you think of the tragedies
you know, you even plan
to write about naming your only
daughter (whenever she is born,
anyway) after a suicide-bomber
you try to think of fear and hate
and some devious defence for all
those sins you had painstakingly
planned to do just so that your
poetry has more life and colour
and verve and in the end it might
appear that you have experience

you strive like mad to avoid writing
poems about your unseen lover,
you concede deep within that you
do not know his name or age or what
he murders for a living, yet he weaves
his way into every poem of yours

you want to write that single poem
which is free of him, which does not
carry the stains of his masculine scent
and which doesn’t make you think of
his hairless chest and the deftness of his
fingers on you and god yes god his eyes
you want to write a poem just for yourself,
a poem where you do not cringe
or stand shame-faced at his
worship of himself and how
silently and steadfastly he
has made you worship him

you have always known that
your knowledge of him was
very limited—that expecting
the stranger to caress you when
you cry is an insane idea—
after all when your lover comes
he has no memory about the
days and months and years he has
spent inside your heart and he does
not wish to hear for how long you
have harboured him right between
your breasts

you notice the clock tick away
and again you give up writing
that poem for it always eludes you

then,

you succumb to all your cravings
and write all you can about him
forgetting the shame and the
embarrassment it would cause
somehow it seems better than
not writing anything at all.

This song of mine will wind its music around you, my child, like

This song of mine will touch your forehead like a kiss of

When you are alone it will sit by your side and whisper in

aloofness.
My song will be like a pair of wings to your dreams, it will
transport your heart to the verge of the unknown.
It will be like the faithful star overhead when dark night is

To weep because a glorious sun has set
Which the next morn shall gild the east again;
To mourn that mighty strengths must yield to fate
Which by that force a double strength attain;
To shrink from pain without whose friendly strife

Who smiling beckons us to farther life,
And is a bridge for the persistent breath;
Despair and anguish and the tragic grief 
Of dry set eyes, or such disastrous tears
As rend the heart, though meant for its relief, 
And all man's ghastly company of fears
Are born of folly that believes the span
Of life the limit of immortal man.",0.0

487,396,"The flight of birds

“a poem should be wordless
as the flight of birds.”
—Archibald Macleish, Ars Poetica.

birds don’t sing in their flight

for them flying is a muse
they compose mid-air
weave agnostic verse
sneering haughtily at our absurdity
as they float over our meaningless mosques and churches
and those patrolled international borders
and other disputed sites
where the guns go bang bang bang all the time
they swing over there losing their birdegos
(ego is difficult to retain in mid-flight)
wondering about and watching men plucking out
and quashing the lives of other men and women and
poor helpless children and they
shed a birdtear or two from there
a birdtear that is lost midway due to heat of some explosion
down below some crazy fanatical bomb detonating
killing instantly the people and the city and the forests
and even the pitiable babybirds who are yet to learn to fly

they contemplate of writing poems
about a bird’s egg charring
before even being boiled and scratch their beaks
unsure if this is a metaphor or simile or other poetic device

o the birds have lots and lots and lots to write about
o their writings will never be banned

they borrow freedom
to write poems in the sky
they come back and
pass it on to us
we take the song only
brutally
but at least we take the song

to take the poem
to unscramble the words from the song and to put it back again
as song so spontaneously that it remains the poem and the song
to remember forever this refrain whose melody haunts us
and to hum that refrain which preserves our sanity
perhaps we need to fly
a trifle aimlessly like birds

or because we are humans
six-sensed creatures with massive egos
and massive superegos and massive egos on the ego
and because of possessing gray matter
what doctors call medulla oblongata
we need to feel with our red hearts
than think with some unlocatable mind

we need to look deeper. . .
into ourselves, into eyes
we need to lose ourselves
then, and only then

the poems will come
silent
wordless
as the flight of birds

Three genteel ladies went lunching
At a sophisticated hotel.
Their elevator door opened;
They gasped, and their faces fell.

A seven-foot man was inside,
With an intimidating expression.
They got in anyway;
They were the very souls of discretion.

""Sit!"" the man yelled, and they sat,
In their luncheon finery,
They went up; then the door slid aside;
The man left, abashedly.

His dog had been behind him;
At lunch they got a note.
The basketball star paid their bill;
""My apologies, and my treat,"" he wrote.

Buster, Sparkle, Newbie, Speedy
and then there’s Pixie our smallest kitty,
One, two, three and four and five,
they’re so frisky, so alive.

Sparkle is my number one,
14 years old and so much fun.
Purrs and snuggles on my shoulder,
she‘s getting slow and somewhat older.
She meows for water from the sink,
I turn it on, for her to drink.

Speedy is my number two,
proud and handsome, I tell you!
He prances like a little pony,
and you know what? That’s no baloney.
He guards the others from above,
and sometimes gives a little shove.

Newbie is my number three,
chubby, plump as one can be.
Always cleaning, always licking, 
he tries to run but his paws keep sticking.
He keeps on searching for a hand,
to scratch under his collar band.

Buster is my number four,
always eating, more and more.
Loves to snack on lots of munchies,
Tender Vittles and some crunchies.
Begging, pleading, day and nights.
""Give me crunchies, or I’ll bite!""

I’ll weep to you about
My landlord, and with
My mature gestures—
You will understand:
The torn sari, disheveled hair
Stifled cries and meek submission.
I was not an untouchable then.

I’ll curse the skies,
And shout: scream to you
Words that incite wrath and
You will definitely know:
The priest, his lecherous eyes,
Glances that disrobed, defiled.
I was not polluting at four feet.

How can I say
Anything, anything
Against my own man?

How?

So I take shelter in silence
Wear it like a mask.
When alone, I stumble
Into a flood of incoherencies. . .

Stress is eating at me every minute and second of the day, how do I cope with the horrible effects and make it go away?

I feel so tired and run down and I don't sleep, I lie in bed at night and wonder why it runs so deep.

Everyone asks why do you look so sad, do I tell them that my stress is eating me up and that I feel really bad?

Does everyone notice how I walk around in a daze, and that I have deep black bags under my eyes nowadays.

I wake up every morning feeling so hopeless, like nothing ever goes right and wondering why my life has to be such a mess.

Stress is my one worst enemy, it’s taken over my mind and my whole life in every single degree.

I seem to have loved you in numberless forms, numberless times…
In life after life, in age after age, forever.
My spellbound heart has made and remade the necklace of songs,
That you take as a gift, wear round your neck in your many forms,
In life after life, in age after age, forever.

Whenever I hear old chronicles of love, its age-old pain,
Its ancient tale of being apart or together.
As I stare on and on into the past, in the end you emerge,
Clad in the light of a pole-star piercing the darkness of time:
You become an image of what is remembered forever.

You and I have floated here on the stream that brings from the fount.
At the heart of time, love of one for another.
We have played along side millions of lovers, shared in the same
Shy sweetness of meeting, the same distressful tears of farewell-
Old love but in shapes that renew and renew forever.

Today it is heaped at your feet, it has found its end in you
The love of all man’s days both past and forever:
Universal joy, universal sorrow, universal life.
The memories of all loves merging with this one love of ours –
And the songs of every poet past and forever.

Why do I stay when I want to go?
Is it because I have hope?
Or maybe it is because I don’t want to be alone.

I stay and all I do is complain.
Complain that I might be going insane.
Insane of the thought that it might be my fault.

But who is to blame?
Is it me or is it him?
Neither one of us will go.

Although we know we must go.
All we do is ignore the pain.
Of all the words we exchange.

I know I must go but I don’t know.
If I go I will be alone.
But why do I stay?
Only to hear him say
“You’re to blame for all my unhappiness and pain.”

I know I’m not to blame for the choices he has made.
So I stay hoping he will grow.

Hath never bent in sorrow of defeat? 
Shalt thou be vanquished, whose imperial feet 
Have shattered armies and stamped empires dead? 
Who shall unking thee, husband of a queen?

Earth's kingdoms fade to a remembered dream, 
But thine henceforth shall be a power supreme, 


Dazzling command and rich dominion,

The silver-belted planets and the sun. 
Where'er the radiance of thy coming fall, 
Shall dawn for thee her saffron footcloths spread, 
Sunset her purple canopies and red, 
In serried splendour, and the night unfold 
Her velvet darkness wrought with starry gold 
For kingly raiment, soft as cygnet-down. 
My hair shall braid thy temples like a crown 
Of sapphires, and my kiss upon thy brows 
Like çithar-music lull thee to repose, 
Till the sun yield thee homage of his light. 


O king, thy kingdom who from thee can wrest? 
What fate shall dare uncrown thee from this breast, 
O god-born lover, whom my love doth gird 
And armour with impregnable delight

I passed into a lucent still abode
And saw as in a mirror crystalline
An ancient Force ascending serpentine
The unhasting spirals of the aeonic road.

Earth was a cradle for the arriving god
And man but a half-dark half-luminous sign
Of the transition of the veiled Divine
From Matter's sleep and the tormented load

Of ignorant life and death to the Spirit's light.
Mind liberated swam Light's ocean vast,
And life escaped from its grey tortured line;

I saw Matter illumining its parent Night.
The soul could feel into infinity cast

Beloved, you may be as all men say
Only a transient spark
Of flickering flame set in loam of clay – 
I care not …since you kindle all my dark
With the immortal lustres of the day.

And as all men deem, dearest, you may be
Only a common shell
Chance-winnowed by the sea-winds from the sea –
The subtle murmurs of eternity.

And tho’ you are, like men or mortal race,
Only a hapless thing
That Death may mar and destiny efface – 
I care not … since unto my heart you bring
The very vision of God’s dwelling-place. ",2.0
520,675,"Never There

You were never there for us,
When we needed you the most,
You would just disappear when things got tough.

And when we did spend time together, 
it would just end in promises that would later be broken, 
and then you were gone giving us no reason at all.

Did you not think that we would care?
Was your life that bad that you had to go and end it there?
Were we not good enough for you?
Was that it?

Holding everyone up taking pictures on tours

So next time you kiss me or take me by the hand

As soft winds sweep away the days
I look back on life through a haze.
Remember playgrounds, parks and friends,
In childlike gaze that never ends.
The laughter in a game of catch,
Shall memory ever attach...
To innocence in youthful eyes,
Catching the ball to Dad's surprise.

I recall my first bike, first wreck,
Who picked me up, said, ""What the heck?""
Convinced me to give one more try,
While, knees skinned, I forgot to cry.
Just the joy knowing he was there,
Making him proud my only care.
There was nothing I couldn't do,
My heart held fast that to be true.

Though teenage years were kind of rough,
I sure wasn't too big or tough.
You taught me to defend what's right
And never back down from a fight.
So I learned the hard way to stand,
Still, with each lump, I found your hand.
Drawing from you an inner strength,
And stubborn pride of equal length.

But there the line of fate was drawn,
As though I blinked and you were gone.
I found myself facing the sun,
Not man, not boy, fatherless, one.
Eyes blinded by a void inside,
I could not live that you had died.
Alas finding it to be true,
I could do nothing without you.

Please, Dad, today just hear my call,
I'm sorry that I dropped the ball.
My life is wrecked, my knees are skinned,
My emotions undisciplined.
I can't get up although I try,
Please don't be upset if I cry.
Though I can't fight what I can't see,
Please, Dad, say you're still proud of me.

I fell against his will
Leaving me hopelessly scared, 
Trapped and good as dead.

No one knows I've got a secret
A secret I couldn't trust someone to keep
No one knows what I went through
The pain and misery I still feel
No one knows except me, God, and the devil too.

She laughs when you make mistakes,
And cries when you ache.
She tells you silly things,
And loves it when you sing..

So weird and funny but its true
She could make you smile when you're blue.
No matter what people say or do,
She'll always stand beside you

But the sad part is,
You never noticed all of these.
You took her for granted, yes you did
Thought it was ok for she was easy to please.

No chocolates, not even roses
No special dates, never gone to places
But it's ok for it didn't matter
Coz you promised to hold her forever.

Sweet words left unspoken,
Romantic moments never happened.
But though you never did what's in her dream,
Holding her hand had always been a perfect scene.

I laugh when you make mistakes
And cry when you ache.
I tell you silly things
I love it when you sing.

So weird and funny but it's true
I've fallen so deeply in love with you
And no matter what people say or do
I'll be here forever loving you.

Simple gestures of love give me shiver
It's like a promise of love forever
And though were not perfect I wont ask for more
Coz you're the only one I've ever dreamt for!!

by Nazrul Islam

English version by Mohammad Omar Farooq
Original Language Bengali

We will meet again in the life Hereafter;
Here, please, forget me with a simple laughter.
Anything that remained unsaid,
I won't say; Let you also keep silence;
If I offer my love, turn me away;
If I persist, hurt me, in pretense.

Dream is broken abruptly here,
The evening's bud sheds in the dawn;
The heart dries up before love is savored;
The ambrosia here has the taste of poison.

In separation here, heart longs in agony;
When together, quickly we go apart;
Where the fountain of love is never dry,
In that everlasting Garden, remember to seek my heart.

HER life is a revolving dream 
Of languid and sequestered ease; 
Her girdles and her fillets gleam 
Like changing fires on sunset seas; 
Her raiment is like morning mist, 
Shot opal, gold and amethyst. 


From thieving light of eyes impure, 
From coveting sun or wind's caress, 
Her days are guarded and secure 
Behind her carven lattices, 
Like jewels in a turbaned crest, 
Like secrets in a lover's breast. 


But though no hand unsanctioned dares 
Unveil the mysteries of her grace, 
Time lifts the curtain unawares, 
And Sorrow looks into her face . . . 
Who shall prevent the subtle years, 
Or shield a woman's eyes from tears?

When I met you, my life changed
Don't know when this feeling came
I got out of bed one morning
Shocked about this feeling

It's not right to love you, I know
But I can't force myself to forget you
You gave color to my life
Though I know the time is not right

I told myself to stay away from you
But I can't teach my heart not to love you
This feeling I had for you keeps growing
A reason for me to be afraid of what this could bring

My mind always telling me to let you go
But my heart is always saying ""I Love You""
This heart really rules my mind
And that is why I can't stop this feeling inside

Asking God to help me to decide
Which one will I follow Heart or Mind?
God has purpose to what I feel
For He only knows about what is real

One thing in common between my heart and mind
Is that they're both saying what is right
My mind is right and so with my heart
But one thing is for sure, You are a part of my Life.

I have exiled my heart.

547,567,"Lover's Gifts XVI: She Dwelt Here by the Pool 

She dwelt here by the pool with its landing-stairs in ruins. Many
an evening she had watched the moon made dizzy by the shaking of
bamboo leaves, and on many a rainy day the smell of the wet earth
had come to her over the young shoots of rice.
Her pet name is known here among those date-palm groves and
in the courtyards where girls sit and talk while stitching their
winter quilts. The water in this pool keeps in its depth the memory
of her swimming limbs, and her wet feet had left their marks, day
after day, on the footpath leading to the village.
The women who come to-day with their vessels to the water have
all seen her smile over simple jests, and the old peasant, taking
his bullocks to their bath, used to stop at her door every day to
greet her.
Many a sailing-boat passes by this village; many a traveller
takes rest beneath that banyan tree; the ferry-boat crosses to
yonder ford carrying crowds to the market; but they never notice
this spot by the village road, near the pool with its ruined
landing-stairs,-where dwelt she whom I love.

Trees, trees, trees
Branches, sticks, leaves
Whipping, gashing, slashing at my arms
I can't get away no matter how fast I run

Tripping, falling, crawling on the floor
Ragged cuts, tattered clothes, jagged breathing as I start to slow
My eyes are heavy, my vision blurred
Distant images start to stir

He's right behind me, he's catching up
I have to keep moving but my legs have had enough
Getting dizzy about to pass out, a distant figure starts to stand out
A distant scream, a whispered plea, I can't believe it came from me

Pulse is racing, a feeling of hands, a gentle hush as I'm helped to stand
It's him, he's caught me, please strength don't leave me yet
Let me be anything but his sullied pet
I have to leave, I have to get away, I fall to my knees and let my head sway

Stopping he stares at me and gives a mirrored laugh
Then he reaches for me as I start to move back
I'm to slow, he's to fast, I can't get away, he's taking me back
I can't let this happen, I must react

Heads to fuzzy, I'm getting to weak
I'm stumbling over my own feet
One chance, a pull, a twist, a po+A71p and a moan
I'm not the one with a broken bone

I'm still running, he's still coming
My strength's about to give out
Dead end, cliffs end, water and rocks below
Tell me, if you had a choice which way would you go?

My bed smells of textbooks
and it is more than a month or so,
since I dreamt of sunlight and the sky’s
embrace. Even a woman’s lush vanities —
scarlet silk and shining gold — have been lost
on me. I am snared in a world of aqua, fuchsia,
and lime set dangerously against black and white.

Words tightly wrapped,
and imprisoned in a cluster of
highlighter colours, share my slavery.
Rattling loud, the colorized intrusions
have pickled the past, leaving me to savour
saturation. Oh hell, even my treasured dreams
have been bleached away in shades of three, or five.

Save me, from this
unbearable starkness
of fluorescence; where lines
rehash the pages brutally, moving
with sounds of spectacled scrutiny.
For, all that I can bear to comprehend
is the loss of dare: my sheltered cowardice.
And, the sole comfort I crave, through stifled
tears is stolen love beneath stained glass windows.

Dearest, lavish your love
in slender earthtone shades,
in the colours of skin singing —
to shield our renewed dreams,
and to believe, once more, in absolutes.

Lover's Gifts XLIII: Dying, You Have Left Behind 

Dying, you have left behind you the great sadness of the Eternal
in my life. You have painted my thought's horizon with the sunset
colours of your departure, leaving a track of tears across the
earth to love's heaven. Clasped in your dear arms, life and death
united in me in a marriage bond.
I think I can see you watching there in the balcony with your

If baby only wanted to, he could fly up to heaven this moment.
It is not for nothing that he does not leave us.
He loves to rest his head on mother's bosom, and cannot ever

Baby know all manner of wise words, though few on earth can
understand their meaning.
It is not for nothing that he never wants to speak.
The one thing he wants is to learn mother's words from
mother's lips. That is why he looks so innocent.
Baby had a heap of gold and pearls, yet he came like a beggar
on to this earth.
It is not for nothing he came in such a disguise.
This dear little naked mendicant pretends to be utterly
helpless, so that he may beg for mother's wealth of love.
Baby was so free from every tie in the land of the tiny
crescent moon.
It was not for nothing he gave up his freedom.
He knows that there is room for endless joy in mother's little
corner of a heart, and it is sweeter far than liberty to be caught
and pressed in her dear arms.
Baby never knew how to cry. He dwelt in the land of perfect
bliss.
It is not for nothing he has chosen to shed tears.
Though with the smile of his dear face he draws mother's

Helplessly, silent;
we watched it being seized away, all our lands.
The Government—a fulltime bewitching whore
had promised Jobs. Industrialization. Power, Electric.
Everything went, Nothing came.

Now, landless, uprooted,
unsettled in a resettlement colony
we feast our souls on lucent memories—Of an earlier life.

When memory charts
familiar horizons
I often recollect that
long ago rainy Sunday
in our crowded church,
Fr. Jose reading crisply
“Blessed are the meek
for they shall inherit the earth.”

560,10,"The Gardener LXIV: I Spent My Day 

I spent my day on the scorching
hot dust of the road.
Now, in the cool of the evening, I
knock at the door of the inn. It is 
deserted and in ruins.
A grim ashath tree spreads its 
hungry clutching roots through the
gaping fissures of the walls.
Days have been when wayfarers
came here to wash their weary feet.
They spread their mats in the 
courtyard in the dim light of the
early moon, and sat and talked of
strange lands.
They woke refreshed in the morning
when birds made them glad, and 
friendly flowers nodded their heads 
at them from the wayside.
But no lighted lamp awaited me
when I came here.
The black smudges of smoke left by
many a forgotten evening lamp stare,
like blind eyes, from the wall.
Fireflies flit in the bush near the
dried-up pond, and bamboo branches
fling their shadows on the grass-
grown path.
I am the guest of no one at the end
of my day.
The long night is before me, and I
am tired.

Hands cling to hands and eyes linger

my flute lies on the earth neglected 
and your garland of flowers is
unfinished.
This love between you and me is
simple as a song.
Your veil of the saffron colour
makes my eyes drunk.
The jasmine wreath that you wove
me thrills to my heart like praise.
It is a game of giving and with-
holding, revealing and screening again;
some smiles and some little shyness,
and some sweet useless struggles.
This love between you and me is
simple as a song.
No mystery beyond the present;
no striving for the impossible; no
shadow behind the charm; no groping
in the depth of the dark.
This love between you and me is
simple as a song.
We do not stray out of all words
into the ever silent; we do not raise
our hands to the void for things

Hark, from the minaret, how the muezzin's call 
Floats like a battle-flag over the city wall. 


From trellised balconies, languid and luminous 
Faces gleam, veiled in a splendour voluminous. 


Leisurely elephants wind through the winding lanes, 
Swinging their silver bells hung from their silver chains.

I have thrown from me the whirling dance of mind
And stand now in the spirit's silence free,
Timeless and deathless beyond creature-kind,
The centre of my own eternity.

I have escaped and the small self is dead;
I am immortal, alone, ineffable;
I have gone out from the universe I made,
And have grown nameless and immeasurable.

My mind is hushed in a wide and endless light,
My heart a solitude of delight and peace,
My sense unsnared by touch and sound and sight,
My body a point in white infinities.

I am the one Being's sole immobile Bliss:
No one I am, I who am all that is.",1.0

572,601,"Wet And Wild

I left the city a while back now and came to the mountain top,
I parked me combie in the main street, and said, ""Yeah, this is where I'll stop"".

I'll be seventy-five next birthday, a woman who dives into life,
I missed the hazy hippy years, I think I was someone's wife.

I've changed the way I wear me clothes, no granny prints for me,
A sarong and sandals will do me fine, and dreadlocks wild and free.

I've dispensed with wearin' undies 'cause I want to explore meself,
I burnt the bra long ago and put me bloomers on the shelf.

So, I came up to this magical place to practice me feminine wiles,
I'll not dwell on the years gone past or the fact that I've got piles.

So I sat in a sidewalk café sipping on herbal tea,
I saw him comin' a long way off and shook me dreadlocks free.

I drew the sarong up above me knees, I know he saw me fringe,
'Cause he sat right down in front of me, and said, ""My spiritual name is Quinge"",

I said, ""I'm a mountain woman. Are you a mountain man?"",
A grin split his face from ear to ear and we began to make a plan.

He said, ""I think you're very sexy"", and me fringe began to flutter,
""So when shall we get down to it?"" was all that I could utter.

""With or without sugar?"", he stirred his tea and asked of me,
""With or without teeth?"" I said, my thoughts advanced, you see.

He seemed shocked at my direct reply but I call a spade a spade,
""If you intend to play around with me you'd better sharpen ya blade.""

So Quinge and me got on with it, I taught him a trick or two,
Over fifty don't mean a thing, I know just what to do, 

Wisdom and experience, no games and no bullshit
Is what the years have taught to me and now I'm full of it.

Yeah, I'm just a mountain woman who has a lot of life to live,
I'm just a mountain woman with a lotta love to give.

Always make me feel I belong.

You give guidance when I ask;
It seems you can do most anything;
You're the master of every task.


You're a dependable source of comfort;
You're my cushion when I fall.

You support me whenever I call.

Who wrapped his legs around his neck,
And then he forgot,
How to undo the knot,
And now, he's an absolute wreck! 

And then...

Roses are red,
Delphiniums are blue,
Your father is tall,
What happened to you?

The limerick and play with thought 
Tickle the funny bone you know,
And the best part is knowing naught,
That the bone is at the elbow!

no matter how well I do in school or how well I clean the house
still they aren't happy
from the time I walk in the door till the time I go to bed every night 
the screaming never seems to stop
it used to be just from my mother
but now my father too 
sometimes even my older brother
the one I considered my hero
it hurts...
they tell me I'm crazy, stupid, a mess up
I just want to be good enough for them 
but it seems I never will be
they say they care and they say they love me
but I'm not blind, I can see the hate they have for me
I was a mistake, they didn't believe in abortion
so, here I am, the mistake child
in the dark I sit in my room and cry
day in and day out
their words and looks 
slice into me deeper than any razor ever could
this has went on for years now, 
when will it end?? 
sometimes I wonder what it would be like
if I just got up and left... 
or if I ended it all for good..
or even if I called the police...
but I'm not strong enough to do any of that
I can't last any longer
these people are not my family 
the people I see everyday are monsters
they don't love me, my family did
where did my family go, they are missing :( 
all this yelling is really getting to me
it's breaking me down day by day
soon there will be nothing left
I just want to be left in silence..

596,18,"The Gardener IV: Ah Me 

Ah me, why did they build my
house by the road to the market
town?
They moor their laden boats near
my trees.
They come and go and wander at
their will.
I sit and watch them; my time
wears on.
Turn them away I cannot. And
thus my days pass by.
Night and day their steps sound
by my door.
Vainly I cry, ""I do not know
you.""
Some of them are known to my
fingers, some to my nostrils, the
blood in my veins seems to know
them, and some are known to my
dreams.
Turn them away I cannot. I call
them and say, ""Come to my house
whoever chooses. Yes, come.""
In the morning the bell rings in the
temple.
They come with their baskets in
their hands.
Their feet are rosy red. The early
light of dawn is on their faces.
Turn them away I cannot. I call
them and I say, ""Come to my garden
to gather flowers. Come hither.""
In the mid-day the gong sounds 
at the palace gate.
I know not why they leave their 
work and linger near my hedge.
The flowers in their hair are pale
and faded; the notes are languid in
their flutes.
Turn them away I cannot. I call 
them and say, ""The shade is cool
under my trees. Come, friends.""
At night the crickets chirp in the
woods.
Who is it that comes slowly to my
door and gently knocks?
I vaguely see the face, not a word
is spoken, the stillness of the sky is
all around.
Turn away my silent guest I
cannot. I look at the face through the
dark, and hours of dreams pass by.",2.0

600,847," Fireflies
My fancies are fireflies, — 
Specks of living light
twinkling in the dark.

he voice of wayside pansies,
that do not attract the careless glance,
murmurs in these desultory lines.

In the drowsy dark caves of the mind
dreams build their nest with fragments
dropped from day's caravan.

Spring scatters the petals of flowers
that are not for the fruits of the future,
but for the moment's whim.

Joy freed from the bond of earth's slumber
rushes into numberless leaves,
and dances in the air for a day.

My words that are slight
my lightly dance upon time's waves
when my works havy with import have gone down.

Mind's underground moths
grow filmy wings
and take a farewell flight
in the sunset sky.

The butterfly counts not months but moments,
and has time enough.

My thoughts, like spark, ride on winged surprises,
carrying a single laughter.
The tree gazes in love at its own beautiful shadow
which yet it never can grasp.

Let my love, like sunlight, surround you
and yet give you illumined freedom.

Days are coloured vbubbles
that float upon the surface of fathomless night.

My offerings are too timid to claim your remembrance,
and therefore you may remember them.

Leave out my name from the gift
if it be a burden,
but keep my song.

April, like a child,
writes hieroglyphs on dust with flowers,
wipes them away and forgets.

Memory, the priestess,
kills the present
and offers its heart to the shrine of the dead past.

From the solemn gloom of the temple
children run out to sit in the dust,
God watches them play
and forgets the priest.

My mind starts up at some flash
on the flow of its thoughts
like a brook at a sudden liquid note of its own
that is never repeated.

In the mountain, stillness surges up
to explore its own height;
in the lake, movement stands still
to contemplate its own depth.

The departing night's one kiss
on the closed eyes of morning
glows in the star of dawn.

Maiden, thy beauty is like a fruit
which is yet to mature,
tense with an unyielding secret.

Sorrow that has lost its memory
is like the dumb dark hours
that have no bird songs
but only the cricket's chirp.

Bigotry tries to keep turth safe in its hand
with a grip that kills it.
Wishing to hearten a timid lamp
great night lights all her stars.

Though he holds in his arms the earth-bride,
the sky is ever immensely away.

God seeks comrades and claims love,
the Devil seeks slaves and claims obedience.

The soil in return for her service
keeps the tree tied to her,
the sky asks nothing and leaves it free.

Jewel-like immortal
does not boast of its length of years
but of the scintillating point of its moment.

The child ever dwells in the mystery of ageless time,
unobscured by the dust of history.

Alight laughter in the steps of creation
carries it swiftly across time.

One who was distant came near to me in the morning,
and still nearer when taken away by night.

White and pink oleanders meet
and make merry in different dialects.

When peace is active swepping its dirt, it is storm.

The lake lies low by the hill,
a tearful entreaty of love
at the foot of the inflexible.

There smiles the Divine Child
among his playthings of unmeaning clouds
and ephemeral lights and shadows.

The breeze whispers to the lotus,
""What is thy secret?""
""It is myself,"" says the lotus,
""Steal it and I disappear!""

The freedom of the storm and the bondage of the stem
join hands in the dance of swaying branches.

The jasmine's lisping of love to the sun is her flowers.

The tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom
and yet to keep it for himself.

Gods, tired of their paradise, envy man.

Clouds are hills in vapour,
hills are clouds in stone, —
a phantasy in time's dream.

While God waits for His temple to be built of love,
men bring stones.

I touch God in my song
as the hill touches the far-away sea
with its waterfall.

Light finds her treasure of colours
through the antagonism of clouds.

My heart to-day smiles at its past night of tears
like a wet tree glistening in the sun 
after the rain is over.

I have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitflul,
but have failed to remember the grass
that has ever kept it green.

The one without second is emptiness,
the other one makes it true.

Life's errors cry for the merciful beauty
that can modulate their isolation
into a harmony with the whole.

They expect thanks for the banished nest
because their cage is shapely and secure.

In love I pay my endless debt to thee
for what thou art.

The pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies,
and the sun says, they are good.

Your calumny against the great is impious,
it hurts yourself;
against the small it is mean,
for it hurts the victim.

The first flower that blossomed on this earth
was an invitation to the unborn song.

Dawn—the many-coloured flower—fades,
and then the simple light-fruit,
the sun appears.

The muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom
throttles the voice that would cry.

The wind tries to take the flame by storm 
only to blow it out.

Life's play is swift,
Life's playthings fall behind one by one
and are forgotten.

My flower, seek not thy paradise
in a fool's buttonhole.

Thou hast risen late, my crescent moon,
but my night bird is still awake to greet thee.

Darkness is the veiled bride
silently waiting for the errant light
to return to her bosom.

Trees are the earth's endless effort to
speak to the listening heaven.

The burden of self is lightened
when I laugh at myself.

The weak can be terrible 
because they try furiously to appear strong.

The wind of heaven blows,
The anchor desperately clutches the mud,
and my boat is beating its breast against the chain.

The spirit of death is one,
the spirit of life is many,
Whe God is dead religion becomes one.

The blue of the sky longs for the earth's green,
the wind between them sighs, ""Alas.""
Day's pain muffled by its own glare,
burns among stars in the night.

The stars crowd round the virgin night
in silent awe at her loneliness
that can never be touched.

The cloud gives all its gold
to the departing sun
and greets the rising moon
with only a pale smile.

He who does good comes to the temple gate,
he who loves reaches the shrine.

Flower, have pity for the worm,
it is not a bee,
its love is a blunder and a burden.

With the ruins of terror's triumph
children build their doll's house.

The lamp waits through the long day of neglect
for the flame's kiss in the night.

Feathers in the dust lying lazily content
have forgotten their sky.

The flowers which is single
need not envy the thorns
that are numerous.

The world suffers most from the disinterested tyranny
of its well-wisher.

We gain freedom whrn we have paid the full price
for our right to live.

Your careless gifts of a moment,
like the meteors of an autumn night,
catch fire in the depth of my being.

The faith waiting in the heart of a seed
promises a miracle of life
which it cannot prove at once.

Spring hesitates at winter's door,
but the mango blossom rashly runs our to him
before her time and meets her doom.

The world is the ever-changing foam
thet floats on the surface of a sea of silence.

The two separated shores mingle their voices
in a song of unfathomed tears.

As a river in the sea,
work finds its fulfilment
in the depth of leisure.

I lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost ist bossom,
but the azalea brins to me, my love, thy forgiveness.

Thy shy little pomegranate bud,
blushing to-day behind her veil,
will burst into a passionate flower
to-morrow when I am away.

The clumsiness of power spoils the key,
and uses the pickaxe.

Birth is from the mystery of night
into the grerater mystery of day.

These paper boats of mine are meant to dance
on the ripples of hours,
and not to reach any destination.

Migratory songs wing from my heart
and seek their nests in your voice of love.

The sea of danger, doubt and denial
around man's little island of certainty
challenges him to dare the unknown.

Love punishes when it forgives,
and injured beauty by its awful silence.

You live alone and unrecompensed
because they are afraid of your great worth.

The same sun is newly born in new lands
in a ring of endless dawns.

God is world is ever renewed by death,
a Titan's ever crushed by its own existence.

The glow-worm while exploring the dust
never knows that stars are in the sky.

The tree is of to-day, the flower is old,
it brings with it the message
of the immemorial seed.

Each rose that comes brings me greetings
from the Rose of an eternal spring.
God honours me when I work,
He loves me when I sing.

My love of to-day finds no home
in the nest deserted by yesterday's love.

The fire of pain tracse for my soul
a luminous path across her sorrow.

The grass survives the hill
through its resurrections from countless deaths.

Thou hast vanished from my reach
leaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky,
an invisible image in the wind moving
among the shadows.

In pity for the desolate branch
spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf.

The shy shadow in the farden
loves the sun in silence,
Flowers guess the secret, and mile,
while the leaves whisper.

I leave no trace of wings in the air,
but I am glad I have had my flight.

The fireflies, twinkling among leaves,
make the stars wonder.

The mountain remains unmoved
at its seeming defeat by the mist.

While the rose said to the sun,
""I shall ever remember thee,""
her petals fell to the dust.

Hills are the earth's gesture of despair
for the unreachable.

Though the thorn in thy flower pricked me,
O Beauty,
I am grateful.

The world knows that the few
are more than the many.

Let not my love be a burden on you, my friend,
know that it pays itself.

Dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness,
and is content to vanish when the sun comes out.

Beauty is truth's smile
when she beholds her own face
in a perfect mirror.

The dew-drop knows the sun
only within its own tiny orb.

Forlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages,
swarming in the air, hum round my heart
and seek my voice.

The desert is imprisoned in the wall
of its unbounded barrenness.

In the thrill of little leaves
I see the air's invisible dance,
and in their glimmering
the secret heart-beats of the sky.

You are like a flowering tree,
amazed when I praise you for your gifts.

The earth's sacrifical fire
flames up in her trees,
scattering sparks in flowers.

Foretsts, the clouds of earth,
hold up to the sky their silence,
and clouds from above come down
in resonant showers.

The world speaks to me in pictures,
my soul answers in music.

The sky tells its beads all night
on the countless stars
in memory of the sun.

The darkness of night, like pain, is dumb,
the darkness of dawn, like peace, is silent.

Pride engraves his frowns in stones,
loe offers her surrender in flowers.

The obsequious brush curtails truth
in diference to the canvas which is narrow.

The hill in its longing for the far-away sky
wishes to be like the cloud
with its endless urge of seeking.

To justify their own spilling of ink
they spell the day as night.

Profit smiles on goodness
when the good is profitable.

In its swelling pride
the bubble doubts the turth of the sea,
and laughs and bursts into emptiness.

Love is an endless mystery,
for it has nothing else to explain its.

My clouds, sorrowing in the dark,
forget that they themselves
have hidden the sun.

Man discovers his own wealth
when God comes to ask gifts of him.

You leave your memory as a flame
to my lonely lamp of separation.

I came to offer thee a flower,
but thou must have all my garden,—
It is thine.

The picture—a memory of light
treasured by the shadow.

It is easy to make faces at the sun,
He is exposed by his own light in all
directions.

History slowly smothers its truth,
but hastily struggles to revive it
in the terrible penance of pain.

My work is rewarded in daily wages,
I wait for my final value in love.

Beauty knows to say, ""Enough,""
barbarism clamours for still more.

God loves to see in me, not his servant,
but himself who serves all.

The darkness of night is in harmony with day,
the morning of mist is discordant.

In the bounteous time of roses love is wine,—
it is food in the famished hour
when their petals are shed.

An unknown flower in a strange land
speaks to the poet:
""Are we not of the same soil, my lover?""

I am able to love my God
because He gives me freedom to deny Him.

My untuned strings beg for music
in their anguished cry of shame.

The worm thinks it strange and foolish
that man does not eat his books.

The clouded sky to-day bears the visior
of the shadow of a divine sadness
on the forehead of brooding eternity.

The shade of my tree is for passers-by,
its fruit for the one for whom I wait.

Flushed with the glow of sunset
earth seems like a ripe fruit
ready to be harvested by night.

Light accepts darkness for his spouse
for the sake of creation.

The reed waits for his master's breath,
the Master goes seeking for his reed.

To the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal,
its writing unmeaning.

The sea smites his own barren breast
because he has no flowers to offer to the moon.

The greed for fruit misses the flower.

God in His temple of stars
waits for man to bring him his lamp.

The fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers.
Released from bonds, the shameless flame
dies in barren ashes.

The sky sets no snare to capture the moon,
it is her own freedom which binds her.
The light that fills the sky
seeks its limit in a dew-drop on the grass.

Wealth is the burden of bigness,
Welfare the fulness of being.

The razor-blade is proud of its keenness
when it sneers at the sun.

The butterfly has leisure to love the lotus,
not the bee busily storing honey.

Child, thou bringest to my heart
the babble of the wind and the water,
the flower's speechless secrets, the clouds' dreams,
the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky.

The rainbow among the clouds may be great
but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater.

The mist weaves her net round the morning,
captivates him, and makes him blind.

The Morning Star whispers to Dawn,
""Tell me that you are only for me.""
""Yes,"" she answers,
""And also only for that nameless flower.""

The sky remains infinitely vacant
for earth there to build its heaven with dreams.

Perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt
at being told that it is a fragment
awaiting perfection.

Let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day
and thus win peace for herself.

Beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud,
in the heart of a sweet incompleteness.

Your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings
my sun-flower
and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey.

Leaves are silences
around flowers which are their words.

The tree bears its thousand years
as one large majestic moment.

My offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road,
but for the wayside shrines
that surprise me at every bend.

Hour smile, my love, like the smell of a strange flower,
is simple and inexplicable.

Death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated
for it swells his store with more than he can claim.

The sigh of the shore follows in vain
the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea.

Truth loves its limits,
for there it meets the beautiful.

Between the shores of Me and Thee
there is the loud ocean, my own surging self,
which I long to cross.

The right to possess boasts foolishly
of its right to enjoy.

The rose is a great deal more
than a blushing apology for the thorn.

Day offers to the silence of stars
his golden lute to be tuned
for the endless life.

The wise know how to teach,
the fool how to smite.

The centre is still and silent in the heart
of an enternal dance of circles.

The judge thinks that he is just when he compares
The oil of another's lamp
with the light of his own.

The captive flower in the King's wreath
smiles bitterly when the meadow-flower envies her.

Its store of snow is the hill's own burden,
its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world.

Listen to the prayer of the forest
for its freedom in flowers.

Let your love see me
even through the barrier of nearness.

The spirit of work in creation is there
to carry and help the spirit of play.

To carry the burden of the insturment,
count the cost of its material,
and never to know that it is for music,
is the tragedy of deaf life.

Faith is the bird that feels the light
and sings when the dawn is still dark.

I bring to thee, night, my day's empty cup,
to be cleansed with thy cool darkness
for a new morning's festival.

The mountain fir, in its rustling,
modulates the memory of its fights with the storm
into a hymn of peace.

God honoured me with his fight
when I was rebellious,
He ignored me when I was languid.

The sectarina thinks
that he has the sea
ladled into his private pond.

In the shady depth of life
are the lonely nests of memories
that shrink from words.

Let my love find its strength
in the service of day,
its peace in the union of night.

Life sends up in blades of grass
its silent hymn of praise
to the unnamed Light.

The stars of night are to me
the memorials of my day's faded flowers.

Open thy door to that which must go,
for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed.

True end is not in the reaching of the limit,
but in a completion which is limitless.

The shore whispers to the sea:
""Write to me what thy waves struggle to say.""
The sea writes in foam again and again
and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair.

Let the touch ofthy finger thrill my life's strings
and make the music thine and mine.

The inner world rounded in my life like a fruit,
matured in joy and sorrow,
will drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil
for some further course of creation.

Form is in Matter, rhythm in Force,
meaning in the Person.

There are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth,
I seek thy company so that I may sing.

As the tree its leaves, I shed my words on the earth,
let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence.

My faith in truth, my vision of the perfect,
help thee, Master, in thy creation.

All the delights that I have felt
in life's fruits and flowers
let me offer to thee at the end of the feast,
in a perfect union of love.

Some have thought deeply and explored the
meaning of thy truth,
and they are great;
I have listened to catch the music of thy play,
and I am glad.

The tree is a winged spirit
released from the bondage of seed,
pursuing its adventure of life
across the unknown.

The lotus offers its beauty to the heaven,
the grass its service to the earth.

The sun's kiss mellows into abandonment
the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem.

The flame met the earthen lamp in me,
and what a great marvel of light!

Mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth
and therefore delude us.

The cloud laughed at the rainbow
saying that is was an upstart
gaudy in its emptiness.
The rainbow calmly answered,
""I am as inevitably real as tha sun himself.""

Let me not grope in vain in the dark
but keep my mind still in the faith
that the day will break
and truth will appear
in its simplicity.

Through the silent night
I hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning
knock at my heart.

My new love comes
bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old.

The earth gazes at the moon and wonders
that she sould have all her music in her smile.

Day with its glare of curiosity
puts the stars to flight.

My mind has itstrue union with thee, O sky,
at the window which is mine own,
and not in the open
where thou hast thy sole kingdom.

Man claims God's flowers as his own
when he weaves them in a garland.

The buried city, laid bare to the sun of a new age,
is ashamed that is has lost all its song.

Like my heart's pain that has long missed its meaning,
the sun's rays robed in dark
hide themselves under the ground.
Like my heart'spain at love's sudden touch,
they change their veil at the spring's call
and come out in the carnival of colours,
in flowers and leaves.

My life's empty flute
waits for its final music
like the primal darkness
before the stars came out.

Emancipation from the bondage of the soil
is no freedom for the tree.

The tapestry of life's story is woven
with the threads of life's ties
ever joining and breaking.

Those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words
perch upon my song and dance.

My soul to-night loses itself
in the silent heart of a tree
standing alone among the whispers of immensity.

Pearl shells cast up by the sea
on death's barren beach,—
a magnificent wastefulness of creative life.

The sunlight opens for me the word's gate,
love's light its terasure.

My life like the reed with ist stops,
has its play od colours
through the gaps in its hopes and gains.

Let not my thanks to thee
rob my silence of its fuller homage.

Life's aspirations come
in the guise of children.

The faded flower sighs
that the spring has vanished for ever.

In my life's garden
my wealth has been of the shadows and lights
that are never gathered and stored.

The fruit that I Have gained for ever
is thet which thou hast accepted.

The jasmine knows the sun to be her brother
in the heaven.

Light is young, the ancient light;
shadows are of the moment, they are born old.

I feel that the ferry of my songs at the day's end
will brong me across to the other shore
from where I shall see.

The butterfly flitting from flower to flower
ever remains mine,
I lose the one that is netted by me.

Your voice, free bird, reaches my sleeping nest,
and my drowsy wings dream
of a voyage to the light
above the clouds.

I miss the meaning of my own part
in the play of life
because I know not of the parts
that others play.

The flower sheds all its petals
and finds the fruit.

I leave my songs behind me 
to the bloom of the ever-returning honeysuckles
and the joy of the wind from the south.

Dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil
take part in the life of the forest.

The mind ever seeks its words
from its sounds and silence
as the sky from its darkness and light.

The unseen dark plays on his flute
and the rhythm of light
eddies into stars and suns,
into thoughts and reams.

My songs are to sing
that I have loved Thy singing.

When the voice of the Silent touches my words
I know him and therefore I know myself.

My last salutations are to them
who knew me imperfect and loved me.

Love's gift cannot be given,
it waits to be accepted.

When death comes and whispers to me,
""Thy days are ended,""
let me say to him, ""I have lived in love
and not in mere time.""
He will ask, ""Will thy songs remain?""
I shall say, ""I know not, but this I know
that often when I sang I found my eternity.""

""Let me light my lamp,""
say the star,
'and never debate
if it will help to remove the darkness.""

Before the end of my journey
may I reach within myself
the one which is the all,
leaving the outer shell
to float away with the drifting multitude
upon the current of chance and change.

Why can't you love me and accept me for who I am?
I always try my hardest; I do the best I can.
Can't you see how sad I've been?
The way you treated me must have been a sin.
For a long time, I've tried to make you proud.
But instead of encouraging words, I get put down.
Stop trying to live my life for me.
I'm not a kid anymore, damn it, just let me be.
You don't like my friends, boyfriend, or anything I do.
Tell me, what the hell did I ever do to you?
You married a jerk, who disrespects me.
You always take his side, and turn against me.
I've moved in with my dad and Joan.
They welcomed me with open arms; this is my new home.
They treat me with respect, and they love me for me.
No matter what, I'm here for them, and they're here for me.
I've never felt this happy before; happiness for me was rare.
Now that I'm happy in this new life of mine, do you even care?

602,573,"Our Meeting
Two of us once met
Where the streams of life and death had stopped
Where time stood still.
Today it is so far and away
Now I am sailing alone
My boat is rocking in the storm
I now remember again
How once we met
At the end of the world
Where had descended the heaven.

Forgetting all
We sat there side by side
That day I realized
What sways the blades of grass
Throughout the world
In what delight everything shivers;
In the dark how shine stars;
In what great urge
The breaths of life rush
That day I realized
When we woke up and looked at each other’s face.

Taking your hand in my hand
I kept looking at the sky
We had no words
And didn’t know how our time passed
That day I had realized in my heart of hearts
Where end the meanings of our words
How music rises from the core of the universe
How the pining woods blossom into flowers
These we realized when both of us wept
In endless pleasure.

Then we came to know in what fire
Silently burn the winds of spring
Why the morning sun
Yearns to get lost in everything
Why day and night the river runs
To meet the sea
Why the lightning is hurt by its own light
What game the night plays with dawn
Accepting defeat
All these we realized
When with each other we played
Staking our everything.

by Nazrul Islam

English version by Rachel Fell McDermott
Original Language Bengali

He who has seen my Mother
can he hate his brother?
She loves everyone in the three worlds;
her heart cries for all.
With her there's no difference of caste,
no distinction between high and low;
all are the same.
If she sees a Candala
like Rama with Guhak
she clasps him to her breast.
Ma is our Great Illusion, highest Nature, and
Father our highest Self;
     that's why one feels love for all
     we feel love for all.
If you worship the Mother
hating her children
she won't accept your puja;
the Ten-Armed One will not.
The day we forget the knowledge of difference
          on that day only
          will Ma come home to us.

606,371,"A Boy Named Sue

Well, my daddy left home when I was three,
and he didn't leave much to Ma and me,
just this old guitar and a bottle of booze.
Now I don't blame him because he run and hid,
but the meanest thing that he ever did was
before he left he went and named me Sue.

Well, he must have thought it was quite a joke,
and it got lots of laughs from a lot of folks,
it seems I had to fight my whole life through.
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
and some guy would laugh and I'd bust his head,
I tell you, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue.

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean.
My fist got hard and my wits got keen.
Roamed from town to town to hide my shame,
but I made me a vow to the moon and the stars,
I'd search the honky tonks and bars and kill
that man that gave me that awful name.

But it was Gatlinburg in mid July and I had
just hit town and my throat was dry.
I'd thought i'd stop and have myself a brew.
At an old saloon in a street of mud
and at a table dealing stud sat the dirty,
mangy dog that named me Sue.

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
from a worn-out picture that my mother had
and I knew the scar on his cheek and his evil eye.
He was big and bent and gray and old
and I looked at him and my blood ran cold,
and I said, ""My name is Sue. How do you do?
Now you're gonna die."" Yeah, that's what I told him.

Well, I hit him right between the eyes and he went down
but to my surprise he came up with a knife
and cut off a piece of my ear. But I busted a chair
right across his teeth. And we crashed through
the wall and into the street kicking and a-gouging
in the mud and the blood and the beer.

I tell you I've fought tougher men but I really can't remember when.
He kicked like a mule and bit like a crocodile.
I heard him laughin' and then I heard him cussin',
he went for his gun and I pulled mine first.
He stood there looking at me and I saw him smile.

And he said, ""Son, this world is rough and if
a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
and I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along.
So I gave you that name and I said 'Goodbye'.
I knew you'd have to get tough or die. And it's
that name that helped to make you strong.""

Yeah, he said, ""Now you have just fought one
helluva fight, and I know you hate me and you've
got the right to kill me now and I wouldn't blame you
if you do. But you ought to thank me
before I die for the gravel in your guts and the spit
in your eye because I'm the guy that named you Sue.""
Yeah, what could I do? What could I do?

I got all choked up and I threw down my gun,
called him pa and he called me a son,
and I came away with a different point of view
and I think about him now and then.
Every time I tried, every time I win and if I
ever have a son I think I am gonna name him
Bill or George - anything but Sue.

Mother, let us imagine we are travelling, and passing through a
strange and dangerous country.
You are riding in a palanquin and I am trotting by you on a
red horse.
It is evening and the sun goes down. The waste of Joradighi
lies wan and grey before us. The land is desolate and barren.
You are frightened and thinking-""I know not where we have come
to.""
I say to you, ""Mother, do not be afraid.""
The meadow is prickly with spiky grass, and through it runs
a narrow broken path.
There are no cattle to be seen in the wide field; they have
gone to their village stalls.
It grows dark and dim on the land and sky, and we cannot tell
where we are going.
Suddenly you call me and ask me in a whisper, ""What light is
that near the bank?""
Just then there bursts out a fearful yell, and figures come
running towards us.
You sit crouched in your palanquin and repeat the names of the
gods in prayer.
The bearers, shaking in terror, hide themselves in the thorny
bush.
I shout to you, ""Don't be afraid, mother. I am here.""
With long sticks in their hands and hair all wild about their
heads, they come nearer and nearer.
I shout, ""Have a care, you villains! One step more and you are
dead men.""
They give another terrible yell and rush forward.
You clutch my hand and say, ""Dear boy, for heaven's sake, keep
away from them.""
I say, ""Mother, just you watch me.""
Then I spur my horse for a wild gallop, and my sword and
buckler clash against each other.
The fight becomes so fearful, mother, that it would give you
a cold shudder could you see it from your palanquin.
Many of them fly, and a great number are cut to pieces.
I know you are thinking, sitting all by yourself, that your
boy must be dead by this time.
But I come to you all stained with blood, and say,""Mother, the
fight is over now.""
You come out and kiss me, pressing me to your heart, and you
say to yourself,
""I don't know what I should do if I hadn't my boy to escort
me.""
A thousand useless things happen day after day, and why
couldn't such a thing come true by chance?
It would be like a story in a book.
My brother would say, ""Is it possible? I always thought he was
so delicate!""
Our village people would all say in amazement, ""Was it not

In an arid land of arid human minds
Caste, yet again authored a tragedy.
He, disease wrecked, downtrodden,
long-ago skinner of animals, sets out.
Ten days of Typhoid, and a partial recovery.
Enough reason to thank some God.

He drags himself clumsily to a nearby temple.
Sadly, of an Upper-caste God.
Away from the temple, he bends in supplication.
Says his last prayer—Unwelcome Gratefulness.
To a God who (anyway) didn’t help him recover.
Innocent Acts of Undulating Faith spurned
Anger. Retaliation.

An irked Rajput surged forth
and smote the untouchable with a iron rod.
He, warrior caste lion couldn’t tolerate
Encroachment. At the temple. By a Dalit.
Deathly howls of a feeble-voiced
rent the air, fervently seeking holy intervention.
God, Lifeless as ever—watched grimly with closed eyes.
In resigned submission, the sick man’s Life was given away.
Caste—crueler than disease, emotionless, dry, took its toll
Confirming traditional truths: Dalits die, due to devotion.

Unanswered questions remain;
Agony is not always a forgotten memory.

Life teaches: there are different Gods at different temples.
One solitary thought haunts recollection day and night.
Where did this poor man’s sixty-five year old soul go?
To Heaven – to join noble martyrs who died for a cause?
Or to Hell—where the Gods reside, making Caste Laws.

Ah, these jasmines, these white jasmines!
I seem to remember the first day when I filled my hands with
these jasmines, these white jasmines.
I have loved the sunlight, the sky and the green earth;
I have heard the liquid murmur of the river thorough the
darkness of midnight;
Autumn sunsets have come to me at the bend of a road in the
lonely waste, like a bride raising her veil to accept her lover.
Yet my memory is still sweet with the first white jasmines
that I held in my hands when I was a child.
Many a glad day has come in my life, and I have laughed with
merrymakers on festival nights.
On grey mornings of rain I have crooned many an idle song.
I have worn round my neck the evening wreath of bakulas woven
by the hand of love.
Yet my heart is sweet with the memory of the first fresh

`Prisoner, tell me, who was it that bound you?' 

`It was my master,' said the prisoner. 
`I thought I could outdo everybody in the world in wealth and power, 
and I amassed in my own treasure-house the money due to my king. 
When sleep overcame me I lay upon the bed that was for my lord, 
and on waking up I found I was a prisoner in my own treasure-house.' 

`Prisoner, tell me, who was it that wrought this unbreakable chain?' 

`It was I,' said the prisoner, `who forged this chain very carefully. 
I thought my invincible power would hold the world captive 
leaving me in a freedom undisturbed. 
Thus night and day I worked at the chain 
with huge fires and cruel hard strokes.

While I went off to work one day,
She decided to paint the wall.
And when I came back home that night,
She was curled into a ball.


Her eyes were closed, she was breathing hard,
Her hair was very wet.
From her head to the tips of her pretty toes,
She was covered all in sweat.


She was wrapped in a jacket made of down,
With a fur coat on top of that.
The wall was glowing with new, fresh paint;
On the floor, the paint can sat.


""Sweetheart!"" I cried, with a worried look,
""Are you all right, my dear?""
She lazily opened her lovely eyes,
And smiled from ear to ear.


""I knew I could do it,"" she said with a grin;
""I followed the paint can notes.
It clearly said 'For best results,
Be sure to put on two coats.'""

When you started talking to me again yesterday,
It took me by complete surprise.
I didn't know what to say really, I was in total shock.
I still am even after reading the whole conversation again. 

You seem to have had a change of heart, but I'm not sure why.
I'm glad that you did though, because I missed talking to you.
Maybe you realized that I had no part of it,
That it was all just a misunderstanding.

I still can't believe that you wanted to see me before you left,
After telling me not to talk to you any more.
Then to see the words ""You can call me some if you want."",
Has just really blew my mind!

I'm still not sure what to think of it all,
I guess you can say that I am kind of confused.
All of a sudden here you are saying you want to chill with me,
After telling me that you had changed your mind about anything else.
 
You acted just as interested as you did before,
So I can't help but ask, What's up?
Have you changed your mind, had a change of heart?
I sure hope you have, I had high hopes of it being more.

So I don't know where this will lead,
I have to wait a while to see because you have already left,
But I guess only time will tell!
It is really up to you though, my friend.

is a problem unlike your never-ending
paper or the maddening blankness of
your word processor where you can go on
and on in anguish or insanity or boredom
on one-hundred-and-seven degree Fahrenheit afternoons.
(To write the next lines you need to take
the green&goldbrown duster to rub off these eight)

Colour is another confusion you want
to wish away. At sixteen you wouldn’t write
OneSingleWord unless it was forty percent
gray letters on a plum background and your
monitor looked like a high class youknowwho.
The font then was Footlight MT Light, 13 pt.
Now, at twenty one, it is Verdana, eight point.

NOTHING SEDUCES LIKE YOUR OWN HANDWRITING.
THE WHITE CHALK DANCING ACROSS GLASS GREEN.
Creepers on W’s & R’s, hats on S, hearts on I’s & J’s.

(I have erased again)

I don’t grudge the colours too. Instead of two hundred
and fifty six fantasies there is the catholic bridal white.
Sometimes, there is yellow, blue, green, purple, red and
orange and the opportunity of giving them names—

Flaky Fullmoon. Bleached & Faded Captain Haddock Suit.
Temple-tank Algae. Crushed Lilac Under Flashlight.
Sherbet Stain. Sawdust Chillidust Cream.

(I have erased again)

There is considerable exertion (let me hazard a guess:
writing takes two hundred calories per hour, erasing
with the duster five hundred, and walking across must
be say, around eighty). Then, there is chalk-dust allergy
that compels me to sneeze. And the chemical after-effect
that spoils the moody brown skin of any glowing goddess.

And the unbearable sounds
of chalk squeak. . .
(I have erased again.
The fifth time now.)

But, a poet loves
writing blackboard poems.
(So easy, to imagine, an audience)
Yet, how much she dreads
Impermanence. . .

Leave your books behind.

Since memory,
Like knowledge, is a traitor,
Erase every hoarding of your horrible past.

At last, when you enter her world
Of fraying edges and falling angels
Don’t barter words where touch will do and be the truth.
For once allow her silence to sear, strip your life-layers
Because she who knows the truth will not know the tale.

its mother.
She answered, half crying, half laughing, and clasping the
baby to her breast-
""You were hidden in my heart as its desire, my darling.
You were in the dolls of my childhood's games; and when with
clay I made the image of my god every morning, I made the unmade
you then.
You were enshrined with our household deity, in his worship
I worshipped you.
In all my hopes and my loves, in my life, in the life of my
mother you have lived.
In the lap of the deathless Spirit who rules our home you have
been nursed for ages.
When in girlhood my heart was opening its petals, you hovered
as a fragrance about it.
Your tender softness bloomed in my youthful limbs, like a glow
in the sky before the sunrise.
Heaven's first darling, twain-born with the morning light, you
have floated down the stream of the world's life, and at last you
have stranded on my heart.
As I gaze on your face, mystery overwhelms me; you who belong
to all have become mine.
For fear of losing you I hold you tight to my breast. What
magic has snared the world's treasure in these slender arms of
mine?""",2.0

637,756,"Brink Of Eternity 

In desperate hope I go and search for her 
in all the corners of my room; 
I find her not. 

My house is small 
and what once has gone from it can never be regained. 

But infinite is thy mansion, my lord, 
and seeking her I have to come to thy door. 

I stand under the golden canopy of thine evening sky 
and I lift my eager eyes to thy face. 

I have come to the brink of eternity from which nothing can vanish 
---no hope, no happiness, no vision of a face seen through tears. 

Oh, dip my emptied life into that ocean, 
plunge it into the deepest fullness. 
Let me for once feel that lost sweet touch 
in the allness of the universe.

638,308,"The Golden Boat

Clouds rumbling in the sky; teeming rain.
I sit on the river bank, sad and alone.
The sheaves lie gathered, harvest has ended,
The river is swollen and fierce in its flow.
As we cut the paddy it started to rain. 

One small paddy-field, no one but me -
Flood-waters twisting and swirling everywhere.
Trees on the far bank; smear shadows like ink
On a village painted on deep morning grey.
On this side a paddy-field, no one but me. 

Who is this, steering close to the shore
Singing? I feel that she is someone I know.
The sails are filled wide, she gazes ahead,
Waves break helplessly against the boat each side.
I watch and feel I have seen her face before. 

Oh to what foreign land do you sail?
Come to the bank and moor your boat for a while.
Go where you want to, give where you care to,
But come to the bank a moment, show your smile -
Take away my golden paddy when you sail. 

Take it, take as much as you can load.
Is there more? No, none, I have put it aboard.
My intense labour here by the river -
I have parted with it all, layer upon layer;
Now take me as well, be kind, take me aboard. 

No room, no room, the boat is too small.
Loaded with my gold paddy, the boat is full.
Across the rain-sky clouds heave to and fro,
On the bare river-bank, I remain alone -
What had has gone: the golden boat took all.

O Fool, try to carry thyself upon thy own shoulders! 
O beggar, to come beg at thy own door! 

Leave all thy burdens on his hands who can bear all, 
and never look behind in regret. 

Thy desire at once puts out the light from the lamp it touches with its breath.
It is unholy---take not thy gifts through its unclean hands. 
Accept only what is offered by sacred love.

Green is so important
Because we see it all around
It’s up very high on the trees
And on the grass that is on the ground

Green is the colour of
The plants that grow in the south
It’s also the colour of a Brussels sprout
That I refuse to put in my mouth

Green is on the traffic light
When the cars can go
All the green disappears
When it starts to snow

The most important thing about the colour green
Is because of my mother
NO she is not green
It’s her favourite colour

The night was dark when she went away, and the slept.
The night is dark now, and I call for her, ""Come back, my
darling; the world is asleep; and no one would know, if you came
for a moment while stars are gazing at stars.""
She went away when the trees were in bud and the spring was
young.
Now the flowers are in high bloom and I call, ""Come back, my
darling. The children gather and scatter flowers in reckless sport.
And if you come and take one little blossom no one will miss it.""
Those that used to play are playing still, so spendthrift is
life.
I listen to their chatter and call, ""Come back, my darling,
for mother's heart is full to the brim with love, and if you come
to snatch only one little kiss from her no one will grudge it.""

I tell myself that everything's going to be ok,
that there is no reason for all this pain.
The time it took to change, the time it took to
see all those mistakes.
The life I had, I can't have back. The choices I made,
affected me in all those ways.

The mistakes I made have not been forgotten.
The tears I shed, the sounds I made, the feelings 
that left me feeling in a different way.
Yet I can't see why these tears feel so unreal.
I'm not the same, my words are unsaid.
What I hide, is buried deep inside.

To know, to love, to breathe.
It hurts to know that I'll never be the
girl I used to be. The one that would always laugh,
the one that you knew would always be strong.
The feeling is real, the truth is sealed.
I cry in the dark, cuz I know I cut too deep.

The blood is like the rain, 
in every way it drifts away.
The scars are real, but the wounds in the heart
are another mark.
If you only knew what I've been through,
or maybe you could take a walk in my shoes.

I'm not fake, I'm not a doll,
I just don't think I'm the same in any way.
So where did my soul go?
Why did I ever let it runaway?
What happened to that girl?

The one that could make you laugh,
the one that would always take you out?
What happened to that girl, 
cuz I'm lost without her?
I'm no longer me, the mistakes changed me,
but did they change her? 
If only I would know.

When the two sisters go to fetch
water, they come to this spot and
they smile.
They must be aware of somebody 
who stands behind the trees when-
ever they go to fetch water.
The two sisters whisper to each 
other when they pass this spot.
They must have guessed the secret 
of that somebody who stands behind
the trees whenever they go to
fetch water.
Their pitchers lurch suddenly, and
water spills when they reach this 
spot.
They must have found out that
somebody's heart is beating who 
stands behind the trees whenever
they go to fetch water.
The two sisters glance at each other
when they come to this spot, and they 
smile.
There is a laughter in their swift-
stepping feet, which makes confusion
in somebody's mind who stands behind
the trees whenever they go to

My five year-old-son, he lies a lot,
And I wanted it to end,
So I told him about the boy who cried ""wolf!""
Hoping he would comprehend.


""He kept crying 'wolf!' when there was no wolf,""
I told my son, whom I adore.
""When the wolf came to eat him, he called for help,
But no one listened anymore.""


My son's eyes grew wide; It looked like he got it;
My heart was all aglow.
But he dashed my hopes when he nodded and said,
""I was eaten by a wolf once, you know.""

once—

i was making choices

against the brutal world of

i was craving for security
the kind i had only known while

once—

i ran away in the darkness
nothing beaconed me more than the
prospect-of-solitude-and-the-caress-of-a-million-stars

i ran into the arms of the ravishing night
nothing pulled me back: not even the memories
of-love-i-had-once-known-&-stolen-kisses-savoured-for-so-long.

i ran until terror stopped my tracks
for, trembling i turned and saw that the moon was

Supposing I became a chanpa flower, just for fun, and grew on a
branch high up that tree, and shook in the wind with laughter and
danced upon the newly budded leaves, would you know me, mother?
You would call, ""Baby, where are you?"" and I should laugh to
myself and keep quite quiet.
I should slyly open my petals and watch you at your work.
When after your bath, with wet hair spread on your shoulders,
you walked through the shadow of the champ tree to the little court
where you say your prayers, you would notice the scent of the
flower, but not know that it cane from me.
When after the midday meal you sat at the window reading
ramayana, and the tree's shadow fell over your hair and your lap,
I should fling my wee little shadow on to the page of your book,
just where you were reading.
But would you guess that it was the tiny shadow of your
little child?
When in the evening you went to the cow shed with the lighted
lamp in your hand I should suddenly drop on to the earth again and
be your own baby once more, and beg you to tell me a story.

UNWILLING priestess in thy cruel fane, 
Long hast thou held me, pitiless god of Pain, 
Bound to thy worship by reluctant vows, 
My tired breast girt with suffering, and my brows 
Anointed with perpetual weariness. 
Long have I borne thy service, through the stress 
Of rigorous years, sad days and slumberless nights, 
Performing thine inexorable rites. 


For thy dark altars, balm nor milk nor rice, 
But mine own soul thou'st ta'en for sacrifice: 

All the rich honey of my youth's desire, 
And all the sweet oils from my crushed life drawn, 
And all my flower-like dreams and gem-like fire 
Of hopes up-leaping like the light of dawn. 


I have no more to give, all that was mine 
Is laid, a wrested tribute, at thy shrine; 
Let me depart, for my whole soul is wrung, 
And all my cheerless orisons are sung; 
Let me depart, with faint limbs let me creep 
To some dim shade and sink me down to sleep. ",0.0
663,928,"My True Love

I have a feeling
That I can comprehend
In my deepest thoughts your are
More than just a friend.

I wouldn't want to
Rush us now
As love we explore
But there's a growing love inside
That we just can't ignore.

I love the times we
Spend together. We are comfortable
And free. I think of you when we are
Alone. I think of you and me.

We have a share
Secrets to uncover. There’s more
To life then we will both discover.
I love you always.

I’ll love you when you're dumb,
I’ll love you when you're smart,
I’ll love you anyway you are,
Right from the start.

I’ll love you if you're tall
I’ll love you if you're short,
I’ll love you if you're pretty,
Or just an ugly dork.

I’ll love you if you're toothless,
I’ll love you if you're blind,
Anything that's wrong with you,
To me you'll be fine.

My heart is opening up now,
Unlike it used to do,
I see the pain that's in your heart
And sometimes I feel it to.

I’ll love you tomorrow,
I’ll love you today,
I’ll love you forever,
And forever always.

Which you will never see
You never even call

Who wipes my tears at night
Nor are you the one
Who chases away my frights

Just leave me like this
You didn’t even come back
For one last kiss

That’s no way to behave

For happy daughters and happy wives.

Silver and blue as the mountain mist,
Some are flushed like the buds that dream
On the tranquil brow of a woodland stream,
Some are aglow wth the bloom that cleaves
To the limpid glory of new born leaves

Some are like fields of sunlit corn,
Meet for a bride on her bridal morn,
Some, like the flame of her marriage fire,
Or, rich with the hue of her heart's desire,
Tinkling, luminous, tender, and clear,
Like her bridal laughter and bridal tear.

Some are purple and gold flecked grey
For she who has journeyed through life midway,
Whose hands have cherished, whose love has blest,
And cradled fair sons on her faithful breast,
And serves her household in fruitful pride,
And worships the gods at her husband's side.

Art thou abroad on this stormy night 
on thy journey of love, my friend? 
The sky groans like one in despair. 

I have no sleep tonight. 
Ever and again I open my door and look out on 
the darkness, my friend! 

I can see nothing before me. 
I wonder where lies thy path! 

By what dim shore of the ink-black river, 
by what far edge of the frowning forest, 
through what mazy depth of gloom art thou threading 
thy course to come to me, my friend?

Why do you do this to her? 
Why do you make her cry and hide her fears so deep inside? 
Is she not beautiful enough or does she not have enough wit or charm? 
Why is that you make her feel like a dog that you have chained to the tree and trained to answer only at you’re beck and call? 
Misery and pain is what you have taught her to believe in, 
Will she ever get the courage to run and get away? 
To me you are the devil in disguise 
Constantly standing over her watching from the corner of you’re eye. 
Do you think you’re perfect? 
Do you think that we should just sit back and watch her become more miserable every passing day 
Because you have taught her to believe that without you she can’t get by? 
You credent you rodent you evil man in my eyes 
I see the truth and from me that you can not hide!!!! 
Some may sit back and watch you make her die inside, 
But as for me I will bring back that sparkle I have seen in her eyes.
I will not cover for you I will not lie. 
I will not sit back and let you’re wickedness slowly kill who she really is so deep inside. 
Courage and bravery is what I will make arise from my beautiful aunt. 
You try to keep for yourself to hide you’re own pity and worthlessness, 
you are no better, you are no good, 
Wake up and face the truth 
Without her you are nothing but a menace to society 
A fake a fraud and a pitiful excuse for anyone to call a husband 
But even more you’re not even worth having the title of being called a man. 
Let her go, let her live, let her be set free. 
Hide in you’re corner and reflect on what you are 
Because while you try to hold her there and constantly whisper how she is no good and can never do right.
I will be there beside her constantly praising her and directing her to another world far from you. 
She will win, you will lose and one day she will wake and see you for the beast we know you to be. 
All the misery all the pain all the tears and agony you have dished out
Will one day come to haunt you and bring you down 
The way you have her. 
While you huddle in a corner so lonely and cry your selfish tears. 
She will be happy and free to live her life 
And be able to finally become who she has always wanted to be.........
You’re the devil on her shoulder I’m the angel 
And in the end the good always wins...Because you have to have her. 
I want to have her, you have to make her think you love her 
I just smile and she knows...It’s a fair game 
Let me show you who will win, it will not be you, it will not be me 
But it will be her 
And she will finally be the woman we know her to be. 
I wish you well and bid you goodbye 
Because from this day you are nothing to me but a speck of dirt passing by 
You credent you rodent goodbye!!!

You are a cluster of clouds of the evening sky
I have sought only you all my life
It is you who fills my empty sky
I have made you with the sweet fancies of my mind
You are mine, you are mine
O you wanderer of my boundless sky.

With the blood of my heart I have beautified your feet
My evening dreams are full of you
I have coloured your lips with poison and honey
Mixing with my joys and sorrows
You are mine, you are mine
You have filled my lonely being.

I have coloured your eyes with collyrium
Made of the fancies of my love
You always fill the view of my spellbound eyes
With my music
I have dressed all your limbs
You are mine, you are mine
Both in my life and death you fill my being.

I was told I was living a lie
I was told don't bother to cry
I was told they no longer did care
I was told I love you, they did not dare

I was told I am a bad role model for my sister and brother
I was told I was betrayed by my mother
I was told my mother did not love me
I was told that is why she chose to flee
I was told, the love I have for my mother to hide
I was told I later picked the wrong side

I was told the abuse I got was 'tough love'
I was told that while getting a shove
I was told I brought them to shame
I was told I were many horrible names

I was told I was not the daughter they had in mind
I was told the love for me they could not find
I was told I was expected to fall
I was told they would not help when they received that call

I was told I was going no where
I was told to stay far from there
I was told I would not make much of my life
I was told she'd be the one to cut with a knife
I was told they would leave me alone
I was told I was a daughter disowned
Daddy no longer wants his little girl'

How did you find the energy, Mom
To do all the things you did,
To be teacher, nurse and counselor
To me, when I was a kid.


How did you do it all, Mom,
Be a chauffeur, cook and friend,
Yet find time to be a playmate,
I just can’t comprehend.


I see now it was love, Mom
That made you come whenever I'd call,
Your inexhaustible love, Mom
And I thank you for it all.

Come to my garden walk, my love. Pass by the fervid flowers that
press themselves on your sight. Pass them by, stopping at some
chance joy, which like a sudden wonder of sunset illumines, yet
elude.
For lover's gift is shy, it never tells its name, it flits
across the shade, spreading a shiver of joy along the dust.
Overtake it or miss it for ever. But a gift that can be
grasped is merely a frail flower, or a lamp with flame that will

I must now ebb 
The time has come
to sail my oceans

Rolling away from you
like the waves from the shore
rippling out to the vastness of the sea
that beckons my ship of folly

I'll not ask you
to stand the night vigil
on the shoreline
of memory

You are here
on the beaches of my memory
even though I drift the tides

If you should look
into a starlit night
and see a reflection of me
know only that
I will one day
come crashing again
to the shore
swept homeward
by the pull
of the tide
and
you

I'm the boss
You do not cross
The king of my domain
For the day
No work, all play
Is found in my refrain

Love to eat
The prime of meat
So sad 'til I get some
'Tis so sweet
And such a treat
Boy, they can be so dumb

Hate to dress
Give me caress
No bother with the slime
Have to dig
In it real big
Archaeology time

When I'm beat
I have a seat
Take my favorite spot
No compete
It's so complete
Out of my royal cot! 

Here to stay
I love to lay
Napping is not a farse
I'm a dog
Who's a couch hog
So move your big fat arse!

They clamour and fight, they doubt and despair, they know no end
to their wrangling.
Let your life come amongst them like a flame of light, my
child, unflickering and pure, and delight them into silence.
They are cruel in their greed and their envy, their words are like
hidden knives thirsting for blood.
Go and stand amidst their scowling hearts, my child, and let
your gentle eyes fall upon them like the forgiving peace of the
evening over the strife of the day.
Let them see your face, my child, and thus know the meaning
of all things; let them love you and thus love each other.
Come and take your seat in the bosom of the limitless, my
child. At sunrise open and raise your heart like a blossoming
flower, and at sunset bend your head and in silence complete the
worship of the day.",2.0

A plethora of predicaments race in my mind at best, 
which one can I fathom to ponder about next. 
Shall I even think of acting upon what my mind stirs about, 
or cry my soul asleep by this never ending drought. 
What will my career be, 
the words last resort come screaming at me with no one to yell halt. 
The quick years will pass then they will hit me and it's my own fault. 
All of my solutions come bearing a bag of infinite errors, 
my late night thoughts give me shrieking terrors. 
At what point in time does this maze come to a close. 
On the inside I am slowly weeping but on the outside I pose. 
I look around my room and it does not express myself. 
Question creeps in my eyes at the princess sign of the shelf. 
I am feeling confusion, don't worry not despair. 
All I really want in this life is to be without a care.

and my hands grow full with the daily profits,

---let me not forget for a moment,

When I sit by the roadside, tired and panting, 
when I spread my bed low in the dust, 
let me ever feel that the long journey is still before me 
---let me not forget a moment, 
let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams 
and in my wakeful hours. 

When my rooms have been decked out and the flutes sound 
and the laughter there is loud, 
let me ever feel that I have not invited thee to my house 
---let me not forget for a moment, 
let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams

People care to much.
How their hair looks
or their clothes.
They don't care about what matters
The soul

The soul is what truly matters
that thing that is deep inside.
The soul is always fashionable 
no matter what the season is.

The soul is something that changes color a million times
from when you are born to when you die.
My soul is yellow today 
because I'm happy inside.

On Thursday my soul was green
for I envied another girl.

The soul is by far the best accessory you can have.
And that's what they should write in the magazines.

She is near to my heart as the meadow-flower to the earth; she is
sweet to me as sleep is to tired limbs. My love for her is my life
flowing in its fullness, like a river in autumn flood, running with
serene abandonment. My songs are one with my love, like the murmur
of a stream, that sings with all its waves and current.

Do not keep to yourself the secret of

Say it to me, only to me, in secret.
You who smile so gently, softly
whisper, my heart will hear it, not my
ears.
The night is deep, the house is
silent, the birds' nests are shrouded
with sleep.
Speak to me through hesitating
tears, through faltering smiles, through
sweet shame and pain, the secret of
your heart!

718,672,"The Last Bargain 


""Come and hire me,"" I cried, while in the morning I was walking on the stone-paved road. 
Sword in hand, the King came in his chariot. 
He held my hand and said, ""I will hire you with my power."" 
But his power counted for nought, and he went away in his chariot. 

In the heat of the midday the houses stood with shut doors. 
I wandered along the crooked lane. 
An old man came out with his bag of gold. 
He pondered and said, ""I will hire you with my money."" 
He weighed his coins one by one, but I turned away. 

It was evening. The garden hedge was all aflower. 
The fair maid came out and said, ""I will hire you with a smile."" 
Her smile paled and melted into tears, and she went back alone into the dark. 

The sun glistened on the sand, and the sea waves broke waywardly. 
A child sat playing with shells. 
He raised his head and seemed to know me, and said, ""I hire you with nothing."" 
From thenceforward that bargain struck in child's play made me a free man.

719,279,"The Gods wake up

Another worst things with the Gods is that
They sleep most of the time—
                          (they don’t even dream).
If you happen to go near heaven:
It is a very noisy boring place.
And all that you get to hear there are—
Thirty three million synchronized godly snores.
                          (The Goddesses snore too).

The Gods sleep right through the prayers
Performed by the Brahmins—
                          (maybe they find it boring).
Births, Marriages, innumerable yagnas,
Brahmins take the center-stage, all the
Gods skip. Also, “Om” is now obsolete—
a kind of recurring mosquito buzz.
                          (Besides, Om is ©opyrighted).

At times, the sleeping celestials do stir.
Gods always get excited over funerals—
                          (they are kind of necrophilic).
The loud drums lead the dead to eternal sleep,
Ancient noises herald the escaping life.
This deeper music shakes the skies.
That’s when the Gods wake up.
                          (Just to receive the dead.)

alone again, 
just another day dedicated to love ones missed. 
As I sit with an empty soul, 
not sad, 
not glad but pissed, 
thinking back on happier times 
when those who are gone hugged and kissed. 
But they're gone and the world still turns. 
I put up a bravado that I'm happy, 
but really my heart yearns for those better days 
trips to the beach and sun burns. 
Family get-togethers 
laughs and smile. 
Food collecting on our plates in piles and piles. 
But now all that piles up on my tears, 
most out of heartache but some come from fears. 
I could have hydrated an entire nation over the years. 
Yet I mask them with smiles that are hollow 
in hope that there will always be a better tomorrow. 
But until then you will forever see is my bravado.

I have this illness
that I've suffered from for so long 
and I don't know how
but I've got to find a way to stay strong, 
I wish I could get over it really quick 
because it's making me go insane 
and it hurts when people pick
It just causes so much pain 
I just wish I could stay strong 
It really bothers me 
because I don't know what's wrong 
I'm telling myself not to cry 
but it's so hard to try 
there's got to be a way for me to stay strong 

As the days go by
I feel worse and worse 
so many things have gone wrong 
and it's just so hard to stay strong
I've got to cry 
so as the tears run down my eyes 
I realized I don't have the strength 
to stay strong

I am the blue firmament and the black cloud,
I am the waterfall and the sound thereof,
I am the graven image and the stone by the wayside,
I am the rose and the falling petals thereof,
I am the flower of the field and the sacred lotus,
I am the sanctified waters and the still pool,
I am the tree that towereth among the mountains
And the blade of grass in the peaceful lane,
I am the tender spring leaf and the evergreen foliage.

I am the barbarian and the sage,
I am the impious and the pious,
I am the ungodly and the godly,
I am the harlot and the virgin,
I am the liberated and the man of time,
I am the the indestructible and the destructible,
I am the renunciation and the proud possessor.
I am all
few know me.

I am neither This nor That,
I am neither detached nor attached,
I am neither heaven nor hell -- few know me --
I am neither philosophies nor creeds,
I am neither the Guru nor the disciple.
O friend,
I contain all.

I am clear as the mountain stream,
Simple as the new spring leaf.

Happy are they

Your beauty is unspeakable.
Your love is inescapable. 
And I have fallen deep for you.
The heavens twilight stars,
Lit up the night sky,
And I saw you through the midnight gloom.
Winters death,
Took away my breath,
And stopped the bloom of love.
But the radiance that came from you.
Reflected off the snow,
Melted away all my fears.
And dried all my tears.
Now I pray to see you again.
In the chilled wind,
I smell your perfume. 
My love is only for you.
How long I’ve waited to see your face again.
I wish this wouldn’t end…
I wish I could send,
A love letter straight to your heart.
From me to you, my love is true.
A vampire, I wait outside my tomb.
To see you again
To be in a lovers sin…
I pray unto the gods.
I pray unto it all.
So I wont fall,
Far from you…
Just please my lover take my heart…

by Lalan

English version by Deben Bhattacharya
Original Language Bengali

As the man and the woman in me
Unite in love,
The brilliance of beauty
Balanced on the bi-petalled
Lotus bloom in me
Dazzles my eyes.
The rays
Outshine the moon
And the jewels
Glowing on the hoods of snakes.

My skin and bone
Are turned to gold.
I am the reservoir of love,
Alive as the waves.

A single drop of water
Has grown into a sea,

“Generations to come will scarcely
believe that such a one as this walked
the earth in flesh and blood.”
   —Albert Einstein

Who? Who? Who?
Mahatma. Sorry no.
Truth. Non-violence.
Stop it. Enough taboo.

That trash is long overdue.
You need a thorough review.
Your tax-free salt stimulated our wounds
We gonna sue you, the Congress shoe.

Gone half-cuckoo, you called us names,
You dubbed us pariahs—“Harijans”
goody-goody guys of a bigot god
Ram Ram Hey Ram—boo.

Don’t ever act like a holy saint.
we can see through you, impure you.
Remember, how you dealt with your poor wife.
But, they wrote your books, they made your life.

They stuffed you up, the imposter true.
And sew you up—filled you with virtue
and gave you all that glossy deeds
enough reason we still lick you.

You knew, you bloody well knew,
Caste won’t go, they wouldn’t let it go.
It haunts us now, the way you do
with a spooky stick, a eerie laugh or two.

But they killed you, the naked you,
your blood with mud was gooey goo.
Sadist fool, you killed your body
many times before this too.

Bapu, bapu, you big fraud, we hate you.

742,278,"Breath Of Love

There comes a gentle knocking in this night,
This night where my slumber lays restless.
I tumble and turn to stir my tears.
My eyes open with the rhythm of
the memories that are tapping at my door. 

You have come again to haunt my dreams
And pull back the covers of my heart.
I lay here willing to think of you and 
The youth you gave me so long ago.

How long the breath of love has lay dormant
Resting and waiting, eager to fill me again.
It has slept with its own aloneness where
My canyons echoed the sounds of its silence.

Like a torrent of honey bees your
Love comes to me and steels my sleep.
It wakes my soul and shuffles 
The moments of life that live forever. 

Your embrace is welcomed like an old friend.
I gladly let it wrap its feelings around me.
The tenderness of your kiss quenches me

sitting perched next to my bed
she was singing such a pretty song
I was thinking in my head
so I sat and listened for a while
calm as can be and quite still
till she flew away and perched 
up on my sill

She continued singing a different song
louder than before
curiously I watched her 
and started to get bored
I thought to myself I am tired still
and want to go to bed
so I took my pillow sleepily 
and covered up my head

I waited a while and removed the pillow till
I saw she was still perched on my window sill
I started to turn red
I got up to slam the window closed
and turned to go to bed 
When I saw what I had done 
the little bird was dead

Where there was triumph and happiness 
guilt was replaced instead 
for in my eagerness to go to sleep 
I crushed her little head

What a glorious day 
When our souls intertwined and our hearts danced together.
When you flowed in me and a flower blossomed inside.
When a heart began to beat
Life awoke from sleep all because of us.
Our blood joined and formed a third party
Like a supernatural show of illusion.
Slowly a human was formed 
Inside of another, implanted by yet another.
We amaze me, he amazes me!
You helped me achieve what none can do alone.
I gave you a piece of you and you a piece of me.
The amazing transformation 
from inside to the world was just overwhelming.
I wish you were there.
Just the fact that our baby 
a living, breathing creature of God 
Came and looked at the world for the first time.
He took his first gasp of air, made his first sound.
We created life together.
A bond was built forever in that instant
That you touched so deep and implanted yourself.
Every time I look at him I see you

I see yesterday

I see tomorrow 
I see eternity.

When storm-clouds rumble in the sky and June showers come down.
The moist east wind comes marching over the heath to blow its
bagpipes among the bamboos.
Then crowds of flowers come out of a sudden, from nobody knows
where, and dance upon the grass in wild glee.
Mother, I really think the flowers go to school underground.
They do their lessons with doors shut, and if they want to
come out to play before it is time, their master makes them stand
in a corner.
When the rain come they have their holidays.
Branches clash together in the forest, and the leaves rustle
in the wild wind, the thunder-clouds clap their giant hands and the
flower children rush out in dresses of pink and yellow and white.
Do you know, mother, their home is in the sky, where the stars
are.
Haven't you see how eager they are to get there? Don't you
know why they are in such a hurry?
Of course, I can guess to whom they raise their arms; they
have their mother as I have my own.

The Gardener XIV: I Was Walking by the Road 

I was walking by the road, I do not
know why, when the noonday was past
and bamboo branches rustled in the
wind.
The prone shadows with their out-
stretched arms clung to the feet of
the hurrying light.
The koels were weary of their
songs.
I was walking by the road, I do not 
know why.
The hut by the side of the water is
shaded by an overhanging tree.
Some on was busy with her work,
and her bangles made music in the
corner.
I stood before this hut, I know not
why.
The narrow winding road crosses
many a mustard field, and many a
mango forest.
It passes by the temple of the
village and the market at the river
landing-place.
I stopped by this hut, I do not know
why.
Years ago it was a day of breezy
March when the murmur of the spring
was languorous, and mango blossoms
were dropping on the dust.
The rippling water leapt and licked
the brass vessel that stood on the 
landing-step.
I think of that day of breezy March,
I do not know why.
Shadows are deepening and cattle 
returning to their folds.
The light is grey upon the lonely
meadows, and the villagers are waiting
for the ferry at the bank.
I slowly return upon my steps, I
do not know why.",5.0

But soon vanishes into nothingness,

From the very foundation of the world,
The passing away of all things
Beautiful, joyous and pleasurable.

So am I
In the day of my Liberation
Simple as the tender leaf am I
For in me are many winters and many springs.

When with the day's burden I went home, my love was sitting in the garden idly tearing the leaves of a flower.

I hesitated for a moment, and then placed at her feet all that I had dragged up, and stood silent.

She glanced at them and said, ""What strange things are these? I know not of what use they are!""

I bowed my head in shame and thought, ""I have not fought for these, I did not buy them in the market; they are not fit gifts for her.""

Then the whole night through I flung them one by one into the street.

770,766,"Darkness - a poem by Lord Byron

I had a dream, which was not all a dream.
The bright sun was extinguish'd, and the stars 
Did wander darkling in the eternal space, 
Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth 
Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air;
Morn came, and went and came, and brought no day,
And men forgot their passions in the dread 
Of this desolation; and all hearts 
Were chill'd into a selfish prayer for light:
And they did live by watchfires - and the thrones,
The palaces of crowned kings, the huts, 
The habitations of all things which dwell, 
Were burnt for beacons; cities were consumed, 
And men were gathered round their blazing homes 
To look once more into each other's face; 
Happy were those who dwelt within the eye 
Of the volcanos, and their mountain-torch: 
A fearful hope was all the world contain'd; 
Forest were set on fire but hour by hour 
They fell and faded and the crackling trunks 
Extinguish'd with a crash and all was black. 
The brows of men by the despairing light 
Wore an unearthly aspect, as by fits 
The flashes fell upon them; some lay down 
And hid their eyes and wept; and some did rest
Their chins upon their clenched hands, and smiled;
And others hurried to and fro, and fed 
Their funeral piles with fuel, and looked up 
With mad disquietude on the dull sky, 
The pall of a past world; and then again 
With curses cast them down upon the dust, 
And gnash'd their teeth and howl'd: the wild birds shriek'd,
And, terrified, did flutter on the ground, 
And flap their useless wings; the wildest brutes
Came tame and tremolous; and vipers crawl'd 
And twined themselves among the multitude, 
Hissing, but stingless, they were slain for food:
And War, which for a moment was no more, 
Did glut himself again; a meal was bought 
With blood, and each sate sullenly apart 
Gorging himself in gloom: no love was left; 
All earth was but one thought and that was death,
Immediate and inglorious; and the pang 
Of famine fed upon all entrails men 
Died, and their bones were tombless as their flesh;
The meagre by the meagre were devoured, 
Even dogs assail'd their masters, all save one,
And he was faithful to a corpse, and kept 
The birds and beasts and famish'd men at bay, 
Till hunger clung them, or the dropping dead 
Lured their lank jaws; himself sought out no food,
But with a piteous and perpetual moan 
And a quick desolate cry, licking the hand 
Which answered not with a caress, he died. 
The crowd was famish'd by degrees; but two 
Of an enormous city did survive, And they were enemies; 
They met beside 
The dying embers of an altar-place
Where had been heap'd a mass of holy things 
For an unholy usage; they raked up, 
And shivering scraped with their cold skeleton hands 
The feeble ashes, and their feeble breath 


Blew for a little life, and made a flame
Wich was a mockery; then they lifted up 
Their eyes as it grew lighter, and 
Each other's aspects. saw, and shriek'd, and died, beheld 
Even of their mutual hideousness they died, 
Unknowing who he was upon whose brow 
Famine had written Fiend. The world was void,
The populous and the powerful was a lump, 
Seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless, 
A lump of death, a chaos of hard clay. 
The rivers, lakes, and ocean stood still, 
And nothing stirred within their silent depths; 
Ships sailorless lay rotting on the sea, 
And their masts fell down piecemeal; as they dropp'd 
They slept on the abyss without a surge 
The waves were dead; the tides were in their grave,
The moon their mistress had expired before; 
The winds were withered in the stagnant air, 
And the clouds perish'd; Darkness had no need 
Of aid from them. She was the universe.

an english of tasting with five fingers
an english of talking love with eyes alone

Bless this little heart, this white soul that has won the kiss of
heaven for our earth.
He loves the light of the sun, he loves the sight of his
mother's face.
He has not learned to despise the dust, and to hanker after
gold.
Clasp him to your heart and bless him.
He has come into this land of an hundred cross-roads.
I know not how he chose you from the crowd, came to your door,
and grasped you hand to ask his way.
He will follow you, laughing the talking, and not a doubt in
his heart.
Keep his trust, lead him straight and bless him.
Lay your hand on his head, and pray that though the waves
underneath grow threatening, yet the breath from above may come and
fill his sails and waft him to the heaven of peace.
Forget him not in your hurry, let him come to your heart and
bless him.",2.0

You kept it real
You told no lies
I trusted your words
And you said that it was okay to cry
Hidden from an ocean of lies from the
people closest to me....
But you, you revealed them all
You answered questions never asked
And you showed no regret
And with that I Thank You!
Wishing the truth were lies
Expecting a laugh and you telling me
that it was all a
Joke!
The truth hit me, then stabbed me, then
killed me a thousand
Times....
I cried that night with the never ending
thought of the truth....
I thought I knew my life I thought I
understood it all....
But you opened my eyes and unwrapped
the hurtful truth....
And I Thank You for being there, to hold
my hand....through it all....
And I can never thank you enough for
opening the closet of Skeletons....

HONEY, child, honey, child, whither are you going? 
Would you cast your jewels all to the breezes blowing? 
Would you leave the mother who on golden grain has fed you? 
Would you grieve the lover who is riding forth to wed you?


Mother mine, to the wild forest I am going, 
Where upon the champa boughs the champa buds are blowing; 
To the köil-haunted river-isles where lotus lilies glisten, 
The voices of the fairy folk are calling me: O listen!


Honey, child, honey, child, the world is full of pleasure, 
Of bridal-songs and cradle-songs and sandal-scented leisure. 
Your bridal robes are in the loom, silver and saffron glowing, 
Your bridal cakes are on the hearth: O whither are you going?


The bridal-songs and cradle-songs have cadences of sorrow, 
The laughter of the sun to-day, the wind of death to-morrow. 
Far sweeter sound the forest-notes where forest-streams are falling; 
O mother mine, I cannot stay, the fairy-folk are calling.

783,592,"The Gardener LIX: O Woman 

O woman, you are not merely the
handiwork of God, but also of men;
these are ever endowing you with
beauty from their hearts.
Poets are weaving for you a web
with threads of golden imagery;
painters are giving your form ever
new immortality.
The sea gives its pearls, the mines
their gold, the summer gardens their
flowers to deck you, to cover you, to
make you more precious.
The desire of men's hearts has shed
its glory over your youth.
You are one half woman and one
half dream.

784,108,"The Gardener XLVI: You Left Me 

You left me and went on your way.
I thought I should mourn for you
and set your solitary image in my
heart wrought in a golden song.
But ah, my evil fortune, time is 
short.
Youth wanes year after year; the
spring days are fugitive; the frail
flowers die for nothing, and the wise
man warns me that life is but a
dewdrop on the lotus leaf.
Should I neglect all this to gaze after
one who has turned her back on me?
That would be rude and foolish,
for time is short.
Then, come, my rainy nights with
pattering feet; smile, my golden 
autumn; come, careless April, scatter-
ing your kisses abroad.
You come, and you, and you also!
My loves, you know we are mortals.
Is it wise to break one's heart for the 
one who takes her heart away? For
time is short.
It is sweet to sit in a corner to muse
and write in rhymes that you are all
my world.
It is heroic to hug one's sorrow and 
determine not to be consoled.
But a fresh face peeps across my
door and raise its eyes to my eyes.
I cannot but wipe away my tears 
and change the tune of my song.
For time is short.

I want you to have it all
My soul, my mistakes, my heart,
You have the key to my innermost thoughts
Slowly unlocking every door 
That shades you from me, from what I don't want you to see 
MY TRUE COLORS

Running away from you, from the one who 
relates, listens ,and appreciate me for who 
I AM
Chasing you away from my heart, willing to feel lonely
Just so you wont have a way to hurt me.
Constantly chasing you in circles never knowing were it began
and were it will end

You've unlocked everything, you've seen

Only one door left as you open it all you see

791,852,"Forest Fire

Of late I have begun to feel a hunger
To take in with greed, like a forest fire that
Consumes and with each killing gains a wilder,
Brighter charm, all that comes my way. Bald child in
Open pram, you think I only look, and you
Too, slim lovers behind the tree and you, old
Man with paper in your hand and sunlight in
Your hair... My eyes lick at you like flames, my nerves
Consume ; and, when I finish with you, in the
Pram, near the tree and, on the park bench, I spit
Out small heaps of ash, nothing else. But in me
The sights and smells and sounds shall thrive and go on
And on and on. In me shall sleep the baby
That sat in prams and sleep and wake and smile its
Toothless smile. In me shall walk the lovers hand
In hand and in me, where else, the old shall sit
And feel the touch of sun. In me, the street-lamps
Shall glimmer, the cabaret girls cavort, the
Wedding drums resound, the eunuchs swirl coloured
Skirts and sing sad songs of love, the wounded moan,
And in me the dying mother with hopeful
Eyes shall gaze around, seeking her child, now grown
And gone away to other towns, other arms.""

At sunset, on the river ban, Krishna 
Loved her for the last time and left...

That night in her husband's arms, Radha felt 
So dead that he asked, What is wrong, 
Do you mind my kisses, love? And she said, 
No, not at all, but thought, What is 
It to the corpse if the maggots nip?

793,268,"Broken Song
Kasinath the new young singer fills the hall with sound:
The seven notes dance in his throat like seven tame birds.
His voice is a sharp sword slicing and thrusting everywhere,
It darts like lightening - no knowing where it will go when.
He sets deadly traps for himself, then cuts them away:
The courtiers listen in amazement, give frequent gasps of praise.
Only the old king Pratap Ray sits like wood, unmoved.
Haraj Lal is the only singer he likes, all others leave him cold.
From childhood he has spent so long listening to him sing -
Rag Kafi during holi, cloud-songs during the rains,
Songs for Durga at dawn in autumn, songs to bid her farewell -
His heart swelled when he heard them and his eyes swam with tears.
And on days when friends gathered and filled the hall
There were cowherds' songs of Krsna, in raags Bhupali and Multan.

So many nights of wedding-festivity have passed in that royal house:
Servants dressed in red, hundreds of lamps alight:
The bridegroom sitting shyly in his finery and jewels,
Young friends teasing him and whispering in his ear:
Before him, singing raag Sahana, sits Baraj Lal.
The king's heart is full of all those days and songs.
When he hears some other singer, he feels no chord inside,
No sudden magical awakening of memories of the past.
When Pratap Ray watches Kasinath he just sees his wagging head:
Tune after tune after tune, bu none with any echo in the heart.

Kasinath asks for a rest and the singing stops for a space.
Pratap Ray smilingly turns his eyes to Baraj Lal.
He puts his mouth to his ear and says, 'Dear ustad,
Give us a song as songs ought to be, this is no song at all.
It's all tricks and games, like a cat hunting a bird.
We used to hear songs in the old days, today they have no idea.'

Old Baraj Lal, white-haired, white turban on his head,
Bows to the assembled courtiers and slowly takes his seat.
He takes the tanpura in his wasted, heavily veined hand
And with lowered head and closed eyes begins raag Yaman-kalyap.
His quavering voice is swallowed by the enormous hall,
Is like a tiny bird in a storm, unable to fly for all it tries.
Pratap Ray, sitting to the left, encourages him again and again:
'Superb, bravo!' he says in his ear, 'sing out loud.'

The courtiers are inattentive, some whisper amongst themselves,
Some of them yawn, some doze, some go off to their rooms;
Some of them call to servants, 'Bring the bookah, bring some pan.'
Some fan themselves furiously and complain of the heat.
They cannot keep still for a minute, they shuffle or walk about -
The hall was quiet before, but every sort of noise has grown.
The old man's singing is swamped, like a frail boat in a typhoon:
Only his shaky fingering of the tanpura shows it is there.

Music that should rise on its own joy from the depths of the heart
Is crushed by heedless clamour, like a fountain under a stone.
The song and Baraj Lal's feelings go separate ways,
But he sings for all he is worth, to keep up the honour of his king.

One of the verses of the song has somehow slipped from his mind.
He quickly goes back, tries to get it right this time.
Again he forgets, it is lost, he shakes his head at the shame;
He starts the song at the beginning - again he has to stop.
His hand trembles doubly as he prays to his teachers name.
His voice quakes with distress, like a lamp guttering in a breeze.
He abandons the words of the song and tries to salvage the tune,
But suddenly his wide-mouthed singing breaks into loud cries.
The intricate melody goes to the winds, the rhythm is swept away -
Tears snap the thread of the song, cascade like pearls.
In shame he rests his head on the old tanpura in his lap -
He has failed to remember a song:  he weeps as he did as a child.
With brimming eyes king Pratap Ray tenderly touches his friend:
'Come, let us go from here,' he says with kindness and love.
They leave that festive hall with its hundreds of blinding lights.
The two old friends go outside, holding each other's hands.

Baraj says with hands clasped, 'Master, our days are gone.
New men have come now, new styles and customs in the world.
The court we kept is deserted - only the two of us are left.
Don't ask anyone to listen to me now, I beg you at your feet, my lord.
The singer along does not make a song, there has to be someone who hears:
One man opens his throat to sing, the other sings in his mind.
Only when waves fall on the shore do they make a harmonious sound;
Only when breezes shake the woods do we hear a rustling in the leaves.
Only from a marriage of two forces does music arise in the world.
Where there is no love, where listeners are dumb, there never can be song.'

I crawl in bed and lay my head upon my pillow, with thought’s of the day falling away
Behind my eye’s your face comes to me with love, I can see your trust for me in your eye’s
Your windows,
I reach out my hand to you as you turn to leave me. I touch your hand you stop I move to face you to see your soul
As I come to your face only for you to turn away again what are you hiding from, let me see, you tell me that you're worthy of love, you're not free in your heart, you don’t know how to give your heart away
Pain keep’s you scared afraid to be open, fear has you frozen, I place my hand’s along your face bring you down to my eye’s look deep within your window’s to your soul
I see your fear there holding tight to you, I place my lip’s to yours and breathe your air in, in return I breathe mine into you, with one deep breath your wall’s fall and a new feeling is replaced,
Love is now within you I close my eye’s and kiss you good bye, you ask me to stay why must you go you say, I say I have gifted you, my love is now yours keep it safe, share it, love like never before, share the gift we are all giving, 
I turn from you and walk away with joy in my heart, my love for you now is never ending, you will always carry me within your soul, even though I have never been with you.

Your moving,
but not getting to far.

The path your on,
will cause you no change.
But in your deepest dreams,
you suffer much pain.

Will you expand yourself,
or sit and cry?

You want comfort, warmth
and hope.
And by yourself,
It's like catching Smoke.

You bend and twist,
you scream and yell.
For what can you do
When it feels like hell.

Frozen to the path..

No more noisy, loud words from me---such is my master's will. 
Henceforth I deal in whispers. 
The speech of my heart will be carried on in murmurings of a song. 

Men hasten to the King's market. All the buyers and sellers are there. 
But I have my untimely leave in the middle of the day, in the thick of work. 

Let then the flowers come out in my garden, though it is not their time; 
and let the midday bees strike up their lazy hum. 

Full many an hour have I spent in the strife of the good and the evil, 
but now it is the pleasure of my playmate of the empty days to draw my heart on to him; 
and I know not why is this sudden call to what useless inconsequence!

804,74,"Palm Tree
Palm-tree: single-legged giant,
          topping other trees,
            peering at the firmament -
It longs  to pierce the black cloud-ceiling
          and fly away, away, 
            if only it had wings.

The tree  seems to express its wish
          in the tossing of its head:
            its fronds heave and swish -
It thinks, Maybe my leaves are feathers,
          and nothing stops me now
            from rising on their flutter.

All day    the fronds the windblown tree
          soar and flap and shudder
            as though it thinks it can fly,
As though  it wanders in the skies,
          travelling who knows where,
            wheeling past the stars -

And then  as soon as the wind dies down,
          the fronds subside, subside:
            the mind of the tree returns.
To earth,  recalls that earth is its mother:
          and then it likes once more
            its earthly corner. ",2.0

809,273,"An Introduction

I don't know politics but I know the names
Of those in power, and can repeat them like
Days of week, or names of months, beginning with Nehru.
I amIndian, very brown, born inMalabar,
I speak three languages, write in
Two, dream in one.
Don't write in English, they said, English is
Not your mother-tongue. Why not leave
Me alone, critics, friends, visiting cousins,
Every one of you? Why not let me speak in
Any language I like? The language I speak,
Becomes mine, its distortions, its queernesses
All mine, mine alone.
It is half English, halfIndian, funny perhaps, but it is honest,
It is as human as I am human, don't
You see? It voices my joys, my longings, my
Hopes, and it is useful to me as cawing
Is to crows or roaring to the lions, it
Is human speech, the speech of the mind that is
Here and not there, a mind that sees and hears and
Is aware. Not the deaf, blind speech
Of trees in storm or of monsoon clouds or of rain or the
Incoherent mutterings of the blazing
Funeral pyre. I was child, and later they
Told me I grew, for I became tall, my limbs
Swelled and one or two places sprouted hair.
WhenI asked for love, not knowing what else to ask
For, he drew a youth of sixteen into the
Bedroom and closed the door, He did not beat me
But my sad woman-body felt so beaten.
The weight of my breasts and womb crushed me.
I shrank Pitifully.
Then … I wore a shirt and my
Brother's trousers, cut my hair short and ignored
My womanliness. Dress in sarees, be girl
Be wife, they said. Be embroiderer, be cook,
Be a quarreller with servants. Fit in. Oh,
Belong, cried the categorizers. Don't sit
On walls or peep in through our lace-draped windows.
Be Amy, or be Kamala. Or, better
Still, be Madhavikutty. It is time to
Choose a name, a role. Don't play pretending games.
Don't play at schizophrenia or be a
Nympho. Don't cry embarrassingly loud when
Jilted in love … I met a man, loved him. Call
Him not by any name, he is every man
Who wants. a woman, just as I am every
Woman who seeks love. In him . . . the hungry haste
Of rivers, in me . . . the oceans' tireless
Waiting. Who are you, I ask each and everyone,
The answer is, it is I. Anywhere and,
Everywhere, I see the one who calls himself I
In this world, he is tightly packed like the
Sword in its sheath. It is I who drink lonely
Drinks at twelve, midnight, in hotels of strange towns,
It is I who laugh, it is I who make love
And then, feel shame, it is I who lie dying
With a rattle in my throat. I am sinner,
I am saint. I am the beloved and the
Betrayed. I have no joys that are not yours, no
Aches which are not yours. I too call myself I.

This ill temper I have is making me mad
I blow up and I don’t know why
I wish for just a moment I could handle my anger right
I wish for just a moment I could love you right
I wish my attitude would just go away
I wish my anger would stay at bay
This outlook I have on life needs to change
This outlook I have you needs to say the same
I love you deep down inside
I wish you would see
That you’re the only princess for me

The anger I have deep in side
Comes out when I least expect it
This anger I have in me should just go away
This anger I have is an annoyance
This anger I have has messed my life up
This anger I have is stupid
Anger you have messed up my love for you
Anger you have messed up my life
Anger you have destroyed who I am inside and out
Anger you are the devil
Anger you are all that is bad
This anger I have in me has made me fight
A fight that was not worth it

Anger you made me hit the wrong person
Anger you made me do the wrong things
Anger you are the feeling that I would never miss
Anger you have caused me so much sorrow
Anger you have caused nothing but grief.
Anger just go away ",3.0

heart breaking
open wide 

like a grown-up bride
ready to commit
with joy and pride
feeling so very full inside

opening wide
a stretch of beach
for footprints made
side by side
and then swirl inland
a rushing tide

her fingers, playing the melody of her touch. I looked at her face
and struggled with my tears, till the agony of unspoken words burst
my sleep like a bubble.

like a world of silence on fire, and I wondered if at this moment
she had a dream that rhymed with mine.",0.0

823,248,"The Stone Age

Fond husband, ancient settler in the mind, 
Old fat spider, weaving webs of bewilderment, 
Be kind. You turn me into a bird of stone, a granite 
Dove, you build round me a shabby room, 
And stroke my pitted face absent-mindedly while 
You read. With loud talk you bruise my pre-morning sleep, 
You stick a finger into my dreaming eye. And 
Yet, on daydreams, strong men cast their shadows, they sink 
Like white suns in the swell of my Dravidian blood, 
Secretly flow the drains beneath sacred cities. 
When you leave, I drive my blue battered car 
Along the bluer sea. I run up the forty 
Noisy steps to knock at another's door. 
Though peep-holes, the neighbours watch, 
they watch me come 
And go like rain. Ask me, everybody, ask me 
What he sees in me, ask me why he is called a lion, 
A libertine, ask me why his hand sways like a hooded snake 
Before it clasps my pubis. Ask me why like 
A great tree, felled, he slumps against my breasts, 
And sleeps. Ask me why life is short and love is 
Shorter still, ask me what is bliss and what its price....
